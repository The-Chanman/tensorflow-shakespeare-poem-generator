Michael Harboun
A product, concept, and interaction designer who speaks four languages, “fluency” is a term that is close to Michaël Harboun’s life and work.
While receiving his master’s in Interactive Systems and Objects design at Strate College in Sèvres, France, the Luxembourg-born designer worked on product designs for Vitra and Baccarat at Arik Levy’s global design studio; collaborated on a smartphone application with a Harvard University startup; partnered with Alcatel Bell Labs, Paris, on projects exploring the future of video media and connected objects, held workshops on design methodology at Le Laboratoire, Paris; and collaborated with Orange, European telecommunication provider on more intuitive, user-friendly Bluetooth headsets. His award-winning interaction designs have been exhibited throughout France, Korea, Spain, and Monaco, and have been covered in such media outlets at Core77, DesignBoom, and GOOD Magazine, among others.

 

When Michaël is not thinking about the future, he’s filling the present by travelling, taking photographs, drawing, or reading philosophy.
