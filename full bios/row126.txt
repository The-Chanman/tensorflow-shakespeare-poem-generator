Dee Iacopelli
Dee is a project producer at IDEO. Her experience is in conceptualizing high-touch, innovative client events and engagements and facilitating their execution.
Dee’s love for flawless event execution and experience design began when she was a child helping her mom plan family holidays, parties, and reunions, and grew as a teenager in high school when she began designing and executing school-wide events such as pep rallies and prom.
Dee joined IDEO in 2009 as the coordinator for the Consumer Experience design business development group and transitioned into client relationship and project production in 2011. Prior to IDEO, Dee worked for Cooper Software, Inc., a San Francisco based boutique interaction design consulting firm where she honed her project management skills and immersed herself in design research and event execution.
Dee’s passion for philanthropy allows her to serve as an active member of the Junior League of San Francisco, for whose members she designs experiences and events and through which she also works directly with local non-profits. Dee was also instrumental in helping JLSF run two successful annual giving campaigns, create a Corporate Partnership Program blueprint and launch a wildly successful and profitable fundraiser called Touch-A-Truck (https://www.jlsf.org/touch-a-truck/).
Dee holds a B.A. in Sociology and French from Mills College. While at Mills, Dee ran for the Mills Cross Country team and played an important role in helping the team win the Div. III Cal-Pac championships in 1999 and 2001 and go on to the NAIA Div. III Nationals in 1999. She served as Team Captain in 2000 and 2002 and was awarded All-Conference First Team honors in 2001.
In her free time, Dee loves gardening, and spending time with her husband and son on redwood trails.
