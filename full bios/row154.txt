Evan Collisson
Evan brings his love for community to IDEO's Global Talent team, producing tools and resources used across the firm for career development on The Big Book of IDEO. Each week, Evan pulls stories together from every location for IDEO's weekly newsletter, The Weekly WOW, highlighting cultural moments. Evan also balances his time with the San Francisco Production team with whom he helps prototype, craft, and define the studio's growing capabilities and offerings with local project teams to ultimately hammer down and button up tight deadlines with clients.
Prior to joining IDEO in 2014, Evan developed his design chops in Dubai, United Arab Emirates where he experimented in creative direction, branding, and marketing communications for a regional skateboard distributor for over 6 years. The forefront of his energy was dedicated to community engagement in the production of zines, websites, videos, and events in order to document, celebrate, and foster a growing scene where such a market once hardly existed.
