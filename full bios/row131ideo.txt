Sabrina Keller
Sabrina Keller is a leadership coordinator with IDEO's Munich studio. A lover of lists and a perfectionist at heart, she skillfully creates order out of chaos and strives to have a comprehensive overview of the office's working dynamics. Sabrina excels at prioritization and understands that an acute focus on what's important is one of the primary drivers for internal growth.
Prior to coming to IDEO, Sabrina worked as an executive assistant in a variety of office settings. She also continues to work at a bridal shop on the weekends, finding pleasure in helping expectant brides find the perfect dress, and appreciating the contrast it provides to her office job.
Outside of work, Sabrina can often be found indulging in her twin passions of food and travel, ideally both simultaneously.
