Nelson Scholler
Nelson Sch√∂ller is an Industrial Designer at IDEO Shanghai with a passion for human-centered design solutions. Nelson likes to uncover people's unspoken motivations and behaviors in order to reveal inherent user insights and develop beautifully-crafted, holistic solutions that encourage positive change and enhance the human experience.
Belgian-born, Nelson's career started at the age 14, when he dedicated his free time to build elaborately crafted homes for his multiple pets. He later gained a Master degree in Industrial Design from International School of Design in France. During his studies he had the opportunity to work with Zehnder-Group, Tupperware and Carrefour. Some of his work was featured at Pecha-Kucha nights in Paris.
With 4+ years of professional in-house & consultancy experience in Europe, the United States and Asia, Nelson has been fortunate enough to design product & brand experiences for various international clients. When not designing, Nelson loves to travel, cook or geek out on whatever new gadget he gets in his hands.
