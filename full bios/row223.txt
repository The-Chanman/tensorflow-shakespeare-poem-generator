Jessica Pastor Tomas
As a Sr Designer and Prototyper at IDEO, Jessica seeks to use her hands-on background to steer design towards fabrication, by promoting prototyping as a tool to explore, test and communicate ideas at all stages of the product development cycle.
Jessica holds a MS in Design Engineering from the Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain, as well as BS in Education from Universidad Camilo Jose Cela, Madrid. She specialized in Product Design in Rome, Italy where she found herself immersed in a training oriented towards product creation.
She spent the better part of a decade working as Industrial Designer and Prototyper, balancing design and implementation in a wide range of industries: lighting, aviation and ephemeral installations. She recently came back to the Bay from Seattle where she designed the future of air travel through experience prototypes.
In her spare time, Jessica can be found cooking Spanish tapas for friends or experimenting with photography or origami.
