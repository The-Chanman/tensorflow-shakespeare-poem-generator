Njoki Gitahi
Njoki creates impactful visual design as a Senior Communication Designer at IDEO New York. At the core of her work is a desire to understand and powerfully communicate the tacit needs and behaviors that drive individuals, communities and organizations. She believes in finding inspiration in weird places, failing early and often, and introducing others to human-centered design. Njoki has collaborated with diverse teams and clients on a wide range of mission-driven branding, experience, and environmental design projects.
Prior to IDEO, Njoki worked at the American Museum of Natural History in New York as an assistant curator in the petrology collection (technically, she's a rock star). She received her Bachelor of Sciences in Geology from Amherst College and an MFA in Graphic Design from Yale. She credits her experience in the sciences with informing her design processâ€”it turns out the scientific process also involves intensive field research, insight synthesis, and scrappy prototypes.
