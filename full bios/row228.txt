Joe Brown
Joe is a Portfolio Director at IDEO San Francisco where he helps clients build their innovation muscles and rekindle their cultures.
He likes jumping into the ring to wrestle with multi-pronged problems like, How might we make flight delays easier for passengers and simpler for airlines? Or, How might we reimagine schools to support students, parents, teachers, and their communities? Or, How might we rethink call centers to both solve problems and save money?
Prior to IDEO, Joe taught courses in Marketing and Organizational Behavior at Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he also earned his MBA. Before that, he edited textbooks for the SAT, moonlighted as an interaction designer, and sold art in several New York galleries. 
Joe likes finger painting as much as he likes financial modeling, but his true passions are donuts, robots, and pulp crime novels. His one and only patent is for a frozen dessert.
