Matthias Karg
Matthias is an interaction designer with a focus on translating user research insights into digital products, services, and systems. He has extensive experience in prototyping digital and service experiences — from designing micro-interactions to building service MVPs for testing digital platforms in the real world. Matthias enjoys switching back and forth between a strategic lens, and refining design details of individual touchpoints.
When he's not heads-down designing or debating with a teammate, Matthias can be found at a restaurant around the corner overthinking which food to order next, and still end up with a chocolate cake.
Matthias holds a Master's degree in interaction design from Umeå Institute of Design in Sweden, and a BA in product design from HfG Gmuend in Germany.
