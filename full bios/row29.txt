Andrew Reaume
When asked what he does as a communication designer for IDEO, Andrew matter of factly replies, “I designs things that are printed on surfaces and move on screens.” More specifically, Andrew creates immersive, captivating visions of the future using animation, motion graphics, graphic design, music, video, and any other medium necessary to create an emotionally resonant story. He's turned his considerable imagination to projects ranging from the future of automobility for Ford, a 10-year vision for Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, marketing state-of-the-art robotic surgical tools for a Boston-based medical startup, and unlocking the behavior-modification potential of smart watches for patients with diabetes for a global medical device manufacturer, among other diverse challenges.
A Michigan native and former Eagle Scout, Andrew worked as a multi-disciplinary designer for such not for profits as the Michigan Suburbs Alliance and the Ann Arbor Film Festival before moving to Chicago to start his own graphic design shop and work for clients such as Harpo Studios, VSA Partners, and Tom, Dick & Harry Creative. His printed and motion work has been recognized by the Adobe Design Achievement Awards, AIGA Detroit, and the Ann Arbor Film Festival.
Andrew received his BFA in Graphic Design from Eastern Michigan University. When not hiding under a table with a sound mixer during a medical convention or being pushed around in a wheelchair in an empty museum in order to capture the perfect audio and video footage, Andrew can be found playing the singing saw, strumming his mandolin, or making bitters and tinctures in his Logan Square kitchen.
