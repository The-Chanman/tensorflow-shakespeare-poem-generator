Sean Mulholland
Sean is a designer that works at the intersection of brand, storytelling, and technology. His specialty is using digital to connect people. Over the course of his career this domain has been called everything from communications and interaction design to social media to growth hacking to plain old marketing and strategy.
Sean has worked at three startups (including one of his own) and three agencies. In startup land he positioned an IoT product to successfully crowdfund via Indiegogo and built one of the first (legal) means of marketing software via peer-to-peer networks. In agency land he's launched new brands, relaunched classic brands, and helped design a movement for a national non-profit that captured international attention.
Sean writes code by hand but went to art school and holds a BFA.
Fun fact: one time he quit his job and moved to a farm in Oregon.
