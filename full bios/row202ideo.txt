Victoria Hammel
Victoria Hammel is a curious and passionate Interaction Designer at IDEO Chicago, who loves finding the right balance of crafting with her hands, head and heart. She finds just as much inspiration by experimenting with materials, lights, and her camera as she does when soaking in the works of social artist and thought provocateur, Peter Sharp. With a great passion for humans and their stories, Victoria loves to meaningfully address their needs by finding simple, engaging, and non-intrusive solutions to complex problems.
Victoria holds a Master in interaction Design from the Copenhagen institute of Interaction Design and a Masters in Product Design from the Offenbach University of Art and Design. While pursuing her degrees, she gained six years of experience as a flight attendant for Lufthansa. This unique mix of experiences provided her with great empathy, cultural understanding, and a service-oriented mindset, leading her to a more holistic approach to problem-solving and a core set of values which influence her designs today.
Since joining IDEO, Victoria has used this approach when working with clients from various sectors, such as car insurance, mindfulness, kids experiences, online tech recruitment and preventative car maintenance. Her work included concepts for apps, in restaurant experiences, texting services and animations for on boarding experiences. Her work has been recognized by IxDA Interaction Awards and Core77 Awards, exhibited in Copenhagen's Space 10 Future Living Lab, and featured in Dezeen, Co.Design, psfk, Creativepool, and Curbed.
When she's not making the world a better place through design, she can be found sipping Matcha tea, scavenging for new recipes, or observing human behavior during her travels. She also likes practicing newly learned card tricks for her plants or pets, as she appreciates their nonjudgmental demeanor.
