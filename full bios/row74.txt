Bruno Olmedo
Bruno Olmedo is a Design Researcher at IDEO Cambridge, where his passion to understand people drives him to take on any challenge with a human-centered approach. Bruno's curious, collaborative, and energetic spirit brings a contagious energy to identifying user needs, problem-solving, and communicating user insights through stories.
Bruno has a specific interest in making emerging technologies more human, enabling faster, positive impact in the world. He thoroughly enjoys mapping out complex technological systems, overlaying them with human interactions, and designing meaningful touch points between the two. As a fellow of IDEO's R&D network, the CoLab, Bruno led research and created new designs at the intersection of emerging technologies for Fortune 100 companies, including Ford, Citigroup, Exelon, Target, and Nasdaq. Bruno has prototyped new products, ventures, and services in a variety of domains: using blockchain, sensors, and machine learning to enable fleets of automated vehicles to self-repair, supplementing science classrooms across the country through hydroponic units and virtual reality, increasing food transparency through molecular spectroscopy, and creating an alternative, decentralized, blockchain-based credit score.
Bruno holds a BS in Engineering Psychology from Tufts University. Born and raised in Cochabamba, Bolivia, he is fluent in Spanish and is very interested in designing for the Latin American community. When not at the studio, you'll likely find Bruno visiting his family, dancing at a hip hop studio, or backpacking around the world.
