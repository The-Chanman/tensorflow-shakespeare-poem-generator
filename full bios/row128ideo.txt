Rubani Shaw
Rubani is a creative problem solver and production artist who loves nothing more than flawlessly executing each and every detail of a design. Before bringing his impressive systems-thinking skills to bear on projects at IDEO Chicago, Rubani was an Associate Director of Production Design at VSA Partners and a Senior Production Designer at Ogilvy & Mather, where he worked with such high-profile clients as IBM, Cargill and Hyatt, Allstate, CDW and Steppenwolf Theatre.
Born in Western Canada to West Indian parents, Rubani lives by the Antonio Machado quote: “Traveler, there is no path. The path is made by walking.” To that end, he's visited every state in the US (except Maine), has biked across states, hiked in Denali National Park, spent summers climbing the New River and Red River Gorges and is on a quest to snowboard all of major ski resorts. His interest in art, food and culture has lead him to learn the Korean alphabet, which he can also speak poorly along with French and Spanish, and to learn the fine art of chocolate truffle making. He has a BFA in Graphic Design from Andrews University and is a board member of the Active Transportation Alliance.
