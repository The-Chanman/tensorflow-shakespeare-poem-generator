Bobbie Brightman
I assist the leadership team here in London. They are Sue Siddall, Luis Cilimingras, Andrea Kershaw and Steve O'Connor. Previous to this role, I was the Experience Lead along with Lorraine Clarke. I am a keen supporter of creative confidence and have set up & lead quite a few creative sessions here in the London studio. Sessions like Pimp your Panties whilst channelling your inner drag queen, Lingo Bingo, Anti-Valentines musical bingo and card making, Mask design session & Gingerbread house building. I enjoy helping teams with voiceovers so have recorded a few to date. I LOVE event planning and have been known to DJ & Karaoke at some of our events. I am always up for a challenge!
