Josh Schwartzman
An advocate for the simple, practical and pragmatic, Josh Schwartzman is a software engineer and entrepreneur. He is focused on building IDEO's creative products and engineering culture. He is currently focused on helping to build Creative Difference, to help companies assess their creative qualities and inspire them to be more innovative. He looks forward to improving the reach of IDEO's creative products to bring more empathetic and creative energies to the world.
A software engineer since starting his own consulting company at age 14, he's an equal mix of artist and engineer. After growing up in the wilds of Montana he pursued his BFA in New Media at Ryerson University in Toronto, Canada. There, he built talking plants and interactive video installations to delight, amuse and inspire audiences to help them reflect on their humanity and the human-nature-urban relationships.
Previously, Josh was the founder of a collaborative education platform called Dream See Do, which is used by high schools, mindfulness teachers and companies to bring live and collaborative learning, online. He focuses on education because it has such a power to change how we see, think and interact with each other in this world.
He founded a few other startups, most notably nReduce, an online incubator that was free for entrepreneurs who did weekly video check-ins in private cohorts. Over 4,000 people participated in the first three cohorts, many organized local meetups around the world, and some got investment or met co-founders through the program.
