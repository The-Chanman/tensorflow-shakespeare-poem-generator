Peter Jackson
Peter Jackson co-leads the Public Sector Portfolio from IDEO's San Francisco office where he helps governments, non-profits, and enterprises with a public impact mission bring Design Thinking into their organizations in order to create meaningful change in the world. He leads client relationships and programs where the design questions focus on opportunities to make products, services, and organizational cultures more citizen-centered.
His background is in economics, finance, and political science. Prior to joining IDEO, Peter served as communications director to now U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren in her role overseeing the rescue of the U.S. financial system through the Troubled Assets Relief Program. When Warren was tapped by President Obama to lead the establishment of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Peter joined the founding team as senior advisor for communications. Later as the Assistant Director for Consumer Engagement, he created a first-of-its-kind brand management organization within the CFPB in order to realize Warren's vision of a consumer agency that made a break from the failed policies of the past. His team created award-winning tools to help consumer manage their student loan debt and find a good mortgage, and branded it all with a logo the Washington Post called "a conscious departure from the buttoned-down aesthetic of the Beltway."
