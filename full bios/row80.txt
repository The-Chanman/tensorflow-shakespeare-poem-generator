Carlos Torres Tovar
Carlos Arturo Torres, Senior Industrial Designer
Born in the mountains of Colombia, educated in Sweden, and now living in Chicago, Carlos is an incurable explorer who works tirelessly to find elegant solutions to complex problems. Since joining IDEO in 2014, Carlos has collaborated with the Ford Motor Company to imagine the future of global automobility, crafted a community engagement strategy with the Centers of Disease Control to prevent the spread of Zika in Puerto Rico, and helped a medical device startup create a state-of-the art robotic surgical tool, among many other wide-ranging challenges.
Outside of IDEO work, Carlos is developing IKO, an innovative and customizable prosthetics system for kids in collaboration with LEGO's Future Lab and CIREC, a Bogota-based rehabilitation center. Even though it's still in development, IKO has already been recognized with over 30+ international awards including the BraunPrize, Cannes Lions, IDEA, and FastCompany's Innovation by Design Awards.
While still an undergraduate at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Carlos created a single-driver, articulated concept car of the future for Peugeot. His concept, Peugeot RD, was chosen from 3,000 other entries from 96 countries and was built into a full-scale model that was shown at the  Shanghai Motor Show in 2009.
Carlos graduated from the Umeå Institute of Design in Sweden with an MFA in Advanced Product Design, but his biggest achievement yet is being able to make up to 124 lines of Tetris in under two minutes.
