Jon Wettersten
As a director with a focus on software, Jon helps identify and frame the right opportunities for IDEO design teams to create human-centered, holistic technology solutions. Since a growing number of companies now recognize the need to provide digital products and services, it's a particularly exciting time for IDEO to grow and apply our software design capabilities. Jon's liberal arts background with concentrations in math, music, and art means that he treats software, like design, as a creative discipline.
Jon has over 20 years of professional experience in the design and development of user-centered software applications and web-related technologies for a wide range of clients and industries including financial services, healthcare, automotive, utilities, retail, publishing, education, and not-for-profits.
Jon holds a Liberal Arts BA degree with a concentration in Fine Art from St. Olaf College with continued education in computer science at Northwestern University.
