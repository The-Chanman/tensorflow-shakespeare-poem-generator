Jason Wilkins
After his first experience with a welding torch while still a tater tot (tater tot: endearing term for a native Idahoan), Jason knew he was destined to get his hands dirty whenever possible. Now a Senior Design Lead with a focus on Mechanical Engineering at IDEO, he brings analytical problem solving, detailed mechanism design, and hands-on prototyping experience to a variety of projects, especially those in the Medical and Health/Wellness space. Jason has the ability to support a project from early phase concept development through detailed production manufacturing.
Prior to joining IDEO, Jason was a project lead at Sigma Space/NASA Goddard, where he helped environmental scientists design and build high altitude LiDAR climatology instruments. Jason holds a Master of Product Development from Carnegie Mellon University and a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Penn State University.
When not in the shop at IDEO, one might find him out trail ultra-running, backcountry telemark skiing, backpacking, or cycling through the Sierra Nevada.
