Winston Chow
Winston is a brand and business designer at IDEO Shanghai with 11 years of experience in China across retail and branding. He has honed his craft in multinationals, new ventures, as well as his own start-ups.  
Prior to joining IDEO, Winston was Marketing Communications Director at Costa Coffee, helping revamp the brand in China to contend in a hyper-competitive coffee market. Before that, he worked at Neiman Marcus, one of US's top luxury department store brands, helping them to set up its first China e-commerce platform and leading the subsequent hand-off to a US-based team.
Winston has a great passion for crafting holistic user experiences, and applies this to all his projects, including designing retail store concepts and re-engineering brand positioning for major multinationals in China. Some of the clients he has consulted for include: AstraZeneca, Ernst &-Young, Estée Lauder, Ford, Jaguar Land Rover and Nike.
An entrepreneur at heart, Winston also founded and managed Project Aegis, a boutique retail chain and an e-commerce platform in Shanghai focused on men's contemporary fashion labels.
Winston holds a BA in Cognitive Psychology from University of California, Irvine. As a new parent embarking on the journey of fatherhood, he is inspired to uncover business solutions that also drive positive impact in Chinese society. Winston is an avid sneakerhead - and if left to his own devices, would probably work not for money but for sneakers.
