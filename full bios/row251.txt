Jure Martinec
Jure Martinec is a European designer and technologist that acts on the intersection of design, people and technology. As an interaction designer and a developer at IDEO Munich he researches, conceptualises and builds highly functional prototypes across a variety of industries and emerging technologies, such as connected objects, virtual reality or artificial intelligence.
He is interested in how digital might be shaping the world and aims to guide the development of technology into a future we prefer. In his process he designs with technology to learn about it's abilities and implications on products and services. He works closely with people to surface meaningful and sometimes unexpected technological opportunities, and to learn about the impact of it on society and culture at large.
He holds a Bachelor's degree in Graphic and Interactive Communications from the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. He spent part of his studies at KÃ¶ln International School of Design in Cologne, Germany, continually attends international research-oriented schools and workshops, and works on various collaborations in international settings. Prior to IDEO he co-founded Ansambel, a dispersed collective of artists and designers striving to question and progress established practices.
