Matthew Cooper-Wright
Matt is an interaction designer at IDEO in London. He has experience working on a wide range of projects; from the initial strategic thinking, through to design development and implementation. In the last year he has worked on projects involving interface design, smart devices, micro insurance and retail experience design.
Matt has a great depth of technical knowledge and always seeks to use it on projects – from video productions, design, coding to physical production – he enjoys bringing as many of these skills to every project.
After graduating from Nottingham Trent University with a BA in Graphic Design, Matt specialised in wayfinding and digital projects, including the world leading Legible London pedestrian walking information scheme and a multimodal transit information system from TransLink in Vancouver. This experience honed his appreciation of the challenges of helping people navigate complex environments, be they physical or digital.
Since joining IDEO Matt has been championing digital prototyping on projects run out of London and is constantly in search of the next big trend and an understanding of the impact of new technologies and tools.
As part of this obsession with what comes next Matt has been hosting Nerd Nights for the design community to experiment with emerging technologies such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and most importantly, how they can improve our project work.
