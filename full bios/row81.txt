Caroline Gador
Caroline first discovered her love for the intersection of art and science while watching an episode of Unwrapped on the Food Network, discussing the science that goes behind developing flavors for Ben & Jerry's. Since that life-changing moment, Caroline shifted her undergraduate study from Mechanical Engineering at the University of Colorado-Boulder to Food Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, followed by training at The Culinary Institute of America-Greystone.
Since then, Caroline has gone on to work across all areas of the food industry all over the world: flavor development at Firmenich in Geneva, Switzerland, new product development at Burger King Corporation in Miami, global confectionery development for Cadbury in New Jersey, and working for Mattson, America's largest independent food product development consulting firm based in the Bay Area. As of August, 2014, Caroline brings her unique background of food science and culinary to IDEO's Food Studio as Food Scientist and Culinologist.
When not cooking or thinking about food (which sometimes is rare), Caroline has a love of all things active and outdoors including trail running, soccer and skiing.
