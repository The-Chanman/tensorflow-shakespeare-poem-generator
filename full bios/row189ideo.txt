Tobias Toft
As a Design Director and Interaction Designer in IDEOâ€™s Palo Alto studio, Tobias is deeply interested in the way humans relate to technology and the way technology affects our lives. Combining his engineering and design backgrounds with his fascination with cognitive psychology, Tobias loves to build interactive objects and experiences that provoke a visceral, memorable, emotional reaction. He has worked with a range of different industries covering mobile phones, financial services, air travel, media production, as well as medical products. He started his career as a web designer during the first dot-com boom, and has since worked at Nokia, IDEO and most recently Wove, where he led the design and implementation of the first operating system for flexible displays. He is a firm believer in human centered, iterative design processes, rapid prototyping and multidisciplinary teamwork as key elements to developing successful products and services.
