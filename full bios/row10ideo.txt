Lauren Yarmuth
Lauren Yarmuth is a Portfolio Director at IDEO, New York. Trained as an architect, but seasoned as an entrepreneur, her work often takes the form of sustainable / circular design, on projects that range from retail to food systems, and business strategy to brand engagement. With a whole-systems lens, Lauren is driven to find opportunities for shared value and long-term capacity building.
Prior to IDEO, Lauren co-founded a prominent global sustainability consultancy which she ran for nearly a decade. She also served as long-standing faculty at Columbia University where she taught a masters-level course on sustainable technologies. Lauren holds a degree in architecture from the Rhode Island School of Design. She spends her weekends in the Catskill Mountains, where a good day will find her on a bicycle, x-country skis, or cooking a meal over open flames.
