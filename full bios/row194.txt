Hortense Desodt
Hortense Desodt is an Industrial Designer at IDEO San Francisco.

She has worked in multiple industries, including Food & Beverage, Consumer Electronics, Consumer Goods, Soft Goods and Robotics.
Passionate about the relationship between people, objects and environments and about the intersection between physical & digital, her motivation is to use design to create meaningful impact on the world.
Hortense holds a Bachelor Degree in Industrial Design from ISD France and a Master Degree in Industrial Design from ISD India. Her graduation project has been successful during and after college: while designing a new range of mixers for the Indian company Butterfly, not only this project made the brand a leader in that space, but also helped them understand the power of user-centered design. Since then, the company restructured itself, building a team of designers working closely with their consumers.
