Carl David Sjunnesson
David is a Senior Design Lead at IDEO Munich working through the entire spectrum of interaction design - - from small, tangible interactions to large, intangible services. He brings a strong, human-centered approach to everything he designs. Before Munich he spent five years in USA working with a wide range of clients crafting digital and physical experience used by millions.





Before joining IDEO, David worked at Tellart focusing on digital experiences that bridged the physical world and the web for a diverse set of clients such as Google, Humana, and Chicago Children's Hospital. He has received numerous accolades for his work including Cannes Lion, Lovie, IxDa, and SXSW Interactive awards. Before Tellart and IDEO, David ran his own design studio in his homeland of Sweden, where he designed everything from large-scale art installations to educational tools for children and at the same time taught Interaction Design and ran the physical computing laboratory at Malmo University in Sweden.




David holds a Master in Interaction Design from the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design and a bachelor in Interaction Design from Malmo University.




David's work has taken him to many corners of the world - - from South Africa to Norway and many points in between. While travelling and at home, you'll find him with a camera to his eyes and a fork in his hand, ready to take in new sights and unexpected flavors.
