Jeffrey Kessler
Jeff's passions lie in using technological tools to tell stories and create experiences. As a mechatronics engineer at IDEO Palo Alto, he lends his mechanical, electronics, and product design skills to bringing “the future of…” to life, from in-car entertainment to the exam room at the doctor's office.
Before joining IDEO, Jeff co-created an immersive theatrical experience on Alcatraz, designed an educational animatronic puppet, and dabbled in short films and commercial production. Prior to that, he worked for four years as a product development engineer on dimmer switches, thermal printers, and cardiac ablation catheters.
Jeff holds a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Duke University, where he found himself crossing campus and the country to earn a minor in Film/Video/Digital. In search of more skills, Jeff went to Stanford to pursue his MS in Mechanical Engineering. His experience taking classes at Stanford's d.school and teaching the project-based mechatronics sequence awakened him to a synergy between his creative, technical, and collaborative impulses - a sweet spot he continues to cultivate at IDEO.
In 2015, Jeff was named one of 54 "DARPA Risers" for work he did with an IDEO team envisioning the Brain-Actuated Home for veterans with disabilities: short films depicting how cutting-edge neuro-technologies might address real human needs. Outside of IDEO's walls, Jeff loves to speed through crossword puzzles, slog through lines at Disneyland, mentor kids in robotics, and go to the movies. He’s an opinionated cinephile with a soft spot for sci-fi. (Say that three times fast.)
