Keren Bigio
Keren Amit is a senior design researcher and project lead at IDEO. Her work is focused on investigating the relationship between people’s attitudes towards brands, technology and products and how these attitudes influence their behavior. She has particular expertise in international fieldwork and cross-cultural ethnographic research.
Keren is curious about why people do the things they do and what inspires them to act. By applying her understanding of the psychological drivers that typify human behavior, she uncovers insights that shape the development of products and services.
Keren believes in bringing insights to life using a mixture of visual story-telling techniques. In the field, she balances the roles of a verbal and visual observer. Her experience in photography has led to the introduction of new visual ethnography techniques that complement traditional human factors methodologies.
Before joining IDEO, Keren worked as an associate at Insight Research Group, a boutique marketing research firm grounded in the social sciences. She led contextual research projects to inform new product and service innovations.
Keren holds a Master’s degree in Psychology from New York University, with a specialization in Social Psychology.
