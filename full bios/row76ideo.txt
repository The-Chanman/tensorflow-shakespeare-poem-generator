Murphy MacDonald
As a member of the Human Factors team at IDEO Chicago, Murphy MacDonald is especially interested in how human motivation and decision-making can be activated by design. Murphyâ€™s natural curiosity is most at home in contextual observation, where the clearest views of behavior & intention offer the greatest opportunity for understanding rationales & priorities.

Murphy holds an MBA in strategy and marketing from the University of Chicago and a BFA in Industrial Design from Carnegie Mellon University. His experience includes many design, marketing, and strategy projects that create value through mutual advocacy for users and enterprises. Prior to IDEO, Murphy led user research and design strategy efforts for industrial, consumer, and medical clients at Insight Product Development.
