Nili Metuki
Nili Metuki is a senior design lead at IDEO New York with a focus on research and strategy. Having earned a doctorate in psychology, she brings a deep understanding of human behavior to the center of design projects. Since 2012, she led teams to create human-centered products, services, and experiences across a range of sectors, from health care to financial services.
Nili first engaged with IDEO as a client, working for Primesense, an Israeli tech start-up that pioneered a gesture-enabled interaction paradigm. Upon joining IDEO, Nili used this experience to empathize with clients as they navigate the ambiguity of the design process. In particular, she has worked with Scotiabank, NBC, WebMD and New York's DMV to bring new digital experiences, services, and physical branches to market.Â 
Nili looks for inspiration in the ways new technology shapes our lives, and in how thoughtful design can transform everyday experiences. Outside the studio, she teaches Design Thinking and Creative Listening to audiences at universities, conferences, and events. On weekends, Nili can usually be found people watching her way through NYC with her toddler son in tow.
