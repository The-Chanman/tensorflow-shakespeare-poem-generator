Dave Russell
Dave Russell is a Communication Designer at IDEO, where he has worked across industries as diverse as food and beverage, healthcare and financial services. He particularly enjoys the challenge of bringing complex ideas into focus – whether that be helping a pharmaceutical company take a more holistic view of their patient care or defining a future vision for the high street bank.
Dave aims to bring clarity, empathy and a strong aesthetic sensibility to every project. Working across a broad range of media – from print design and illustration to film, animation and writing – he relishes the opportunity to craft compelling stories that inform, inspire and provoke. He recently produced a series of filmed and written ethnographies after spending time observing the lives of elderly people. These stories were used to inspire a public challenge to design for the needs of the ageing population.
Dave studied Graphic Design Communication at Chelsea College of Art in London. During that time he curated and produced work for a pop-up print shop and had work published by D&AD and Wallpaper* magazine. Outside of the studio, he’s convinced one of the best places you can be is in the saddle of a bicycle.
