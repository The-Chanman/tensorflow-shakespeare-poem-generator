Reid Williams
Reid’s passion for science, technology and design began as a kid growing up in Florida, where he learned to draw pictures on an IBM PS/2 computer using BASIC, and “investigated" the social behavior of ants in his backyard. This passion continues at IDEO where Reid brings a science and technology lens to client challenges in product strategy and design.
Prior to IDEO, Reid earned a PhD from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). At UCSF his research focused on using a synthetic biology approach to understand how individual cells sense, compute, and respond to their environment. While at UCSF, Reid also worked with IDEO designers to imagine how future everyday products might be created using biology, and was nominated for a Fast Company Innovation By Design award.
Before UCSF, Reid earned undergraduate and masters degrees in computer science and electrical engineering from MIT. As a masters student he worked in the MIT Media lab developing machine learning techniques and tools to allow a computer to learn basic architectural design rules.
When not being a nerd, Reid spends his time skiing, kiteboarding, brewing beer, and occasionally pickling vegetables.
