Annette Ferrara
A writer by training and inclination, Annette can't remember a time when she wasn't playing with words. Since 2009, she's been the Marketing Lead for IDEO Chicago where she strives to craft compelling stories about the firm's work and culture.
Before that, Annette was an award-winning Senior Writer for IDEO, scribing everything from taglines and video scripts to websites and mobile apps for such diverse clients such as Ford, State Farm, the American Refugee Committee, Kimberly Clark, PNC, and Del Monte, among others. She's a featured storyteller in IDEO U's online "Storytelling for Influence&quot; class and has authored numerous articles on storytelling and culture for Harvard Business Review, Medium, Art Forum, and other publications.
Prior to IDEO, Annette was the head copywriter for Crate & Barrel, the founder and editor in chief of _TENbyTEN_magazine, the managing editor of Flavorpill Chicago, and the co-author of Xtreme Interiors.
Annette might have earned her MA from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago and her BA from Chatham University, but she was born with an absurd sense of humor and a very loud laugh. These traits have come in handy as a performer and co-producer of MORTIFIED Chicago, a live comedy show where real people read their teenage diaries in front of total strangers.
