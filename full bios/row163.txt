Franziska Mayer
As a product designer with IDEO’s Munich studio, Franzi is committed to creating new user experiences and products that have a positive impact on people’s lives and the environment. Armed with the constant desire to uncover people’s unspoken needs, and understand their behaviors and motivations, she believes in the power of design to have an impact in the world, improving life not just for a select few, but for the entire community. Franzi is particularly interested in discerning the social, ethical and cultural implications of her designs, and applying those findings to construct outcomes that promote social engagement and behavioral change.
Prior to IDEO, Franzi was a design intern with LUNAR Europe. She holds a bachelor’s degree in industrial and product design from the Hochschule für Gestaltung Schwäbisch Gmünd, which included a semester of study at Lund University in Sweden.
