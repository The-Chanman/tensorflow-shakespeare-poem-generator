Juho Parviainen
Juho Parviainen believes in democratising technology, and making it work for people (rather than the other way round). 
Passionate about crafting better, and more delightful everyday products and services, Juho has spent more than a decade leading digital design on projects across sectors including retail, gaming, telecoms, and media. Juho's time at IDEO was punctuated by two years on IKEA's global communications team, where he built digital tools to align communications and brand, supported the launch of new collections, and helped the business become more customer focused. 
As well as fostering IDEO's interaction design community, Juho has taught human centred design at Hyper Island, where he studied digital media and creative technology, and mentored startups at Seedcamp Week. 
Listed as a co-inventor on a digital television patent, Juho has a terrible singing voice, and is an avid marathon and ultra-distance runner.
