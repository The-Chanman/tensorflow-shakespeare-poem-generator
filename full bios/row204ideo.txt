Vivian Barad
As a Director in IDEO's Design for Food Studio, Vivian focuses on helping our clients find new business opportunities as well as develop brands that help people enjoy healthier and better food, beverage products, and experiences. She spends a lot of time thinking about the intersection of food and health - - from personal health to the health of the environment. Clients include the CDC, Campbell's, St. Joseph's Health System, Pernod-Ricard, and Whitewave Foods. An industrial designer by training, she loves getting tangible and present in all of her work is a keen eye to visual details, a passion for a great narrative and a strong desire to simplify.
She is a graduate of California College of the Arts, where she earned a BFA with high distinction in Industrial Design, and where she teaches an Industrial Design studio class from time to time. Before going back to school for her BFA, Vivian earned a BA in English, with distinction, from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. She worked for several years in New York City as a journalist.
In her free time, she gardens, does trail runs, volunteers at her kids' Spanish immersion public school and coaches her daughter's 5th grade soccer team.
