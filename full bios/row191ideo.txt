Toi Valentine
Toi Valentine is a Design Researcher at IDEO working primarily with the Health practice. Her background is rooted in design, and as a result, she values using insights to drive the imagining and realization of future products and services. Toi enjoys designing and facilitating research approaches that uncover the explicit and implicit from both people and organizations. Understanding this intersection allows her to build work that inspires, creates value, and minimizes risk.
Prior to IDEO, Toi was at Adaptive Path leading service and interaction design projects across industries and at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, part of the Innovation Lab, where she facilitated the design of future patient-centric services, products, and environments. Her work has included design and planning for a future hospital, education for first-time investors, tools for small business owners, and a variety of patient safety efforts to reduce human error.
Toi holds a BBA in Design and Management concentrating on Design Strategy and Communication Design from Parsons The New School for Design. Toi has previous experience in action sports, film, and fashion, which have also played a role in shaping her perspective. Outside of IDEO, she can be found co-teaching at the California College of the Arts. She is an avid traveler and adventure-seeker.
