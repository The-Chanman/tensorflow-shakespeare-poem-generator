Ovetta Sampson
As a senior design researcher at IDEO Ovetta works to be the voice of people while inspiring design. Prior to IDEO, she worked as a UX researcher, doing everything from conducting qualitative research to usability tests to quantitative studies. Her UX work spans various platforms including websites, mobile applications, software development and AI/intelligent design.

In a previous life, (she's had many) she was a journalist for about 20 years having her work appear in such publications as The Washington Post, the Colorado Springs Gazette, The Chicago Tribune and the Christian Science Monitor. (She still writes for publications on occasion and authors books). She left the newspaper world for adventure and became a global writer and editor for humanitarian organizations interviewing people all over the world. Along the way she picked up some website design, data visualizations and mobile application coding skills (enough to be dangerous) and fell in love with designing and crafting digital products.

She has her M.S. in Computer Science, specializing in human-computer interaction, from DePaul University.

When not working, Ovetta is swimming, biking and running, preferably in that order and in exotic locales. And occasionally, does these races called Ironmans.
