Hailey Brewer
Hailey leads client relationships and programs within IDEO’s Public Sector Portfolio. She helps IDEO teams empathize with their clients and design for the incredible opportunities and constraints that define innovation in public service.
Most recently, Hailey led a collaboration with the nascent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to develop a truly '21st century government' brand identity and strategy for consumer engagement. Hailey has helped the Social Security Administration rethink how Americans file for retirement and has helped the U.S. Office of Personnel Management connect with a new generation of talent. She has also led relationships with the General Services Administration, the U.S. Department of Education, the Partnership for Public Service and St. Joseph's Health System.
Hailey discovered the power of design thinking through her work with NGO’s in Latin America, first as a student of international relations and later as a program manager for the Foundation for Sustainable Development. After seeing design thinking help people find innovative and contextually appropriate solutions to local community needs in Chile, Nicaragua and Ecuador, she sought out the experts to learn more.
Hailey holds a Bachelor of Arts in International Relations and Latin American Studies from Tufts University.
