Michael Chapman
A classically trained anthropologist, Michael joined IDEO in 2007 with over nine years of experience leading ethnographic and traditional qualitative research teams at such renowned market-research agencies as Research International, MindSpark, and E-Lab/Sapient. Michael’s intense curiosity about the human condition has led him to research a diverse cross-section of social groups, from construction workers to gang members, homemakers to the homeless, and extreme athletes to the elderly. His equally varied client list includes Sprint, General Mills, Unilever, PNC Bank, Kohler, Samsung, and a major American auto company, among others.
The former president of the Chicago Association of the Practice of Anthropology, Michael is currently a member of both the American Anthropological Association and the Society for Applied Anthropology. He holds a master’s in Social Science from the University of Chicago and a bachelor’s in Cultural Anthropology from the University of Southern California
