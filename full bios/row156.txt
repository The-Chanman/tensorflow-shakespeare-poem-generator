Fabian Herrmann
Fabian is a Senior Communication Design Lead at IDEO San Francisco. His focus is on challenges at the intersection of business and brand â€“ where shaping a business, product or service go hand in hand with its expression and communication. He enjoys passionate strategic discussions just as much as detailed typographic tweaking, and is motivated by the opportunity to influence an organization strategically and to bring that strategy to life through design.
At IDEO, Fabian has helped Los Angeles win the 2028 Olympic Games, envisioned the future of pet care for a national veterinary organization, and helped numerous start-ups define how their brand shows up in the world. With over a decade of experience, he came to IDEO from design consultancy Pentagram in London, where as an Associate Partner he led projects ranging from global rebrands and packaging solutions to wayfinding systems and editorial design.
Fabian's work has received awards from numerous industry organizations, including the Tokyo Type Directors Club, the British D&AD, and the American Art Directors Club. His love for all things visual is rivaled by a secret passion for systems and spreadsheets.
