Charlota Blunarova
Charlota is a Communication Designer and Visual Storyteller at IDEO Munich. She transforms analytical design strategy and research into compelling visual stories and experiences. 
With her multidisciplinary background and passion for brand identities and user experience, she looks to combine the power of traditional and digital media to tell stories in unique and meaningful ways. Charlota believes in finding inspiration in weird places, creating stuff with heart, soul and voice, failing early and often, and learning something new everyday. 
Prior to joining IDEO, Charlota worked as a designer on projects ranging from brand identities, editorial design, illustration and digital experience. For five years she also run her photography studio which allowed her to build her storytelling skills by meeting interesting people and capturing their stories. 
Charlota is always up to explore another corner of the world with a camera on her neck. She often gets nerdy about picturing sci-fi visions of the near future, and in free time slowly builds her collection of notebooks full of little illustrations.
Charlota grew up in Czechia, earned her Bachelors degree in Industrial Design from Brno University of Technology an spent part of her studies in Salzburg University of Applied Science studying Product Design.
