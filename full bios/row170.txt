Gemma Lord
A Communication Designer at IDEO, Gemma works to craft narrative through design. With a penchant for making maps, she likes to think through complex systems and strategies, while also designing delightful everyday experiences for real people. If she wants to impress someone, Gemma would tell them that she investigates how design can be used as a medium to question social, cultural and political facets of emerging movements, technologies and phenomena. But in reality, she just wants a dog.
Gemma has a Masters in European Design from The Glasgow School of Art, and has also studied at ENSCI / Les Ateliers in Paris, Konstfack in Stockholm and SVA in New York. Her project Arctic Alba, researching what would happen if Scotland became an Arctic-facing nation, earned Gemma the Newbery Medal, for the top graduating student at Glasgow School of Art. 
Prior to joining IDEO, Gemma worked as an interaction designer at Native, designed kettles in Hong Kong, was an Assistant Art Director at Eastenders, researched synthetic biology and designed speculative creatures for Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg. She earned her stripes at Normally as a researcher, strategist, interaction designer and data explorer. 
Aside from being a designer, Gemma is an unprofessional cyclist, overscrupulous illustrator and wilderness yearner.
