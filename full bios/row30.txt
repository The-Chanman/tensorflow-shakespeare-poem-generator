Andy Deakin
Andy joined our IDEO London office as a modelmaker in 1990 where he trained in various rapid prototyping processes, including moulding technology, computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided machining (CAM). The collaborative, cross-disciplinary approach to modelmaking he and his colleges developed at the London office created something very different from a traditional modelmaking practice the result was a more integrated, iterative, prototyping culture that spanned the length and breadth of the product design process.
In 1995, he took 2 years out to travel. During which time he worked in an architectural studio in Melbourne, Australia, introducing product design and rapid prototyping to their business development.
Since his return to IDEO in 1997 Andy has played a design role in a wide variety of projects covering areas such as manufacturing processes, exhibition design, product design and interaction design and is credited on numerous projects for his design work.
In 2001 Andy transferred to our San Francisco office. During the last two years has added packaging design, Human Factures research and environments design, to the diversity of his work.
He recently completed a concept project exploring the emerging design opportunities in the Mobile home market.
