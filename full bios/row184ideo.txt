Tim Bouckley
Tim is a senior interaction designer at IDEO London. He's keenly interested in designing at the overlap between physical and digital experience. Whether envisioning the roadmap for future connected vehicles, or producing award winning dining experiences for the hospitality sector, Tim strives to make complex services not only tangible, but delightful and memorable.
Educated in Innovation Design Engineering at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London, Tim combines the approaches of art and science, and is equally at home sketching out designs that tell a powerful story, or fine-tuning electronics prototypes.
Tim has had former lives in both Fine Art and Industrial Design, exhibiting at the Venice Biennale, and working for Art Lebedev in Moscow. Both of these experiences directly feed into Tim's highly visual and hands-on approach to the design and innovation space.
