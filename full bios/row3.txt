Adam Cristobal
As a Principal Interaction Designer at IDEO, Adam is most excited by visually beautiful digital products that support human emotional wellbeing. He pushes the craft of interaction design towards a greater sensitivity to how people feel, think, and identify, with a keen eye for visual eloquence. Some of his favorite projects include work with Mercedes-Benz, Ford, and ALDO.
Prior to IDEO, Adam was the Editor-in-Chief of SAD Mag (sadmag.ca), an award-winning and nationally-distributed Canadian arts and culture magazine. He also led the design for children's entertainment applications at a start-up for brands including Richard Scarry's Busytown and Sandra Boynton. He holds a Master of Design in Interaction and Communication Design from Emily Carr University of Art + Design in Vancouver. At Emily Carr, he lectured in the department of communication design, and led digital research projects funded by the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.
