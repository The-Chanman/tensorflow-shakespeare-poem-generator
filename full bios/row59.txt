Becky Lee
Becky is part of the Design for Learning studio, where she works closely with partners in the education space to craft design engagements that drive progress across the sector. She has designed programs to help school leaders reimagine business models, inspire young people in the UAE to envision the future, and build digital skills across Latin America. Becky loves learning just about anything, from a new bus route to a new language, and is particularly interested in cultural exchange, literacy, and equity in education.
Prior to IDEO, Becky spent a year at a university in southern Brazil learning Portuguese and teaching English through the Fulbright U.S. Student Program. She also spent 3 years at Nielsen, the global research firm, where she built long term partnerships with major media companies, helped launch mobile TV ratings, and studied the economic impact of binge watching. She earned degrees in English and Psychology from Cornell University and tries to understand human behavior by reading a lot of books.
She has taught many subjects in many places, from SAT Prep in New Jersey to photography in Thailand, and continues to volunteer as an English teacher and college advisor in San Francisco. In her free time, she enjoys coming-of-age stories, street art, and spontaneous camping trips.
