Dav Rauch
After 20 years combining interaction, design and storytelling on pictures such as Iron Man and Avatar, Dav is now a director of new product development focused on immersive experience design, with a special emphasis on emerging tech such as VR/AR, haptics, physical interaction. Most recently Dav has helped shape design visions for the future of gaming, a robotic vision system for the blind, an app designed to keep HIV+ youth adherent to their meds, a “phygital” game to help kids understand coding, the consumer experience of autonomous space flight, and redesigning Judaism to fit more seamlessly into our lives. Dav has been invited to give talks at events such as the SemiPermanent Design Conferences, the San Francisco Film Society, The Film Society of Lincoln Center, and American Cinemateque. A Taurus on the cusp of Aries, Dav enjoys sunset jaunts along the beach, cooking, eating, surfing and star spangled pants.
