Lynda Deakin
Lynda Deakin, a Partner at IDEO, brings eighteen years of experience working with a broad range of food and beverage clients to her work. She is the Managing Director of IDEO's Food Studio, helping companies solve their toughest problems and identify opportunities for growth.
The Food Studio's empathic approach enables clients to address people's unmet desires and empowers them to tackle a wide variety of design and innovation challenges - - from designing the next $100M product to creating strategic development platforms.
Lynda has collaborated with clients that range from larger food companies such as ConAgra, Whitewave Foods and The Hershey Company to smaller start-ups and agents of change that are trying to reshape the future of food. She believes that design is a tool that can help us build a more sustainable food system while also changing consumers' behaviors for the better.
