Jessie Cutts
Jessie Cutts is a communication designer at IDEO London, where she specializes in helping clients speak to their customers in relevant, appropriate, and engaging ways.
Jessie excels at graphic design, illustration, and photography—at tries to bring at least one of these disciplines to everything she does. Her passion for colorful storytelling is apparent in her work on projects like developing tote bags for Havaianas, doing animation for OpenIDEO, and helping a network of philanthropic advisors more effectively connect with people.
Prior to IDEO, Jessie worked as a graphic designer for her sister’s firm, Cutts Creative, in Australia and advertising agencies in England. She has a degree in illustration from Queensland College of Art. Her hobbies are dancing, cycling, wearing fantastic shoes, and knitting, albeit not necessarily at the same time; she saves her multitasking energy for the office.
Jessie co-authored an article about the future of philanthropy with Felicitas von Peter in Alliance Magazine called “Beyond the Donation” (September 2010).
