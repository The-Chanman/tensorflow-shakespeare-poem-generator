Devin Peek
Devin was one of those kids who grew up creating fingerpaint "masterpieces" that her parents happily stuck up on the fridge. From messy art projects to epic bedtime stories, creativity was always encouraged in the Peek household. Today, she's an avid fan of documentaries, Humans of New York, and The Selby - basically, anything that gives a glimpse into other people's lives and their stories. This love for art and storytelling has played throughout the various stages of Devin's personal and professional life.
At IDEO, she does all things pertaining to digital marketing, from crafting IDEO's stories to managing IDEO's many websites and social media channels. She was on the global team that launched the Kelley brothers' new book, Creative Confidence. With a background in design, Devin is passionate about elevating the way in which people consume stories and how digital can push the preconceived notions of "storytelling."
Prior to IDEO, she spent time in advertising as a visual effects producer, where she worked with a team of creatives to produce animations, live action video, and print campaigns for brands such as Audi, Nike, Google, FitBit, Virgin America and Acura.
Devin holds a BS in Graphic Communication with a minor in Anthropology from Cal Poly - San Luis Obispo. When she's not in the ballet studio or on the rock climbing wall, she can be found eating her way through San Francisco. Check out her 2014 Chomp List.
