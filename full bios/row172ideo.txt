Stina Jonsson
Stina Jonsson is a senior interaction designer at IDEO London. Since joining in 2008, she has had the opportunity to work on a diverse set of projects ranging from consumer products to highly specialised and complex tools for professionals as well as projects ranging from strategic, ambiguous and exploratory to more implementation focused. Stina’s knowledge of human cognition and social psychology heavily informs her work. She is interested in the examination of the human mind, its models, systems, processes, and elements to emulate or take inspiration from to improve our digital experience. She enjoys taking an active role in the research phase and translating research insights into design solutions. As a designer, Stina has a healthy disrespect for conventions and likes to challenge the team to push boundaries. Storytelling is one of her passions.
Stina holds a master’s degree in Interaction Design from the Umeå Institute of Design in Sweden, an institution grounded in the Scandinavian human-centered design approach. Prior to finding her way to the design world, Stina studied at Umeå University where she graduated with a master's degree in Cognitive Psychology.
