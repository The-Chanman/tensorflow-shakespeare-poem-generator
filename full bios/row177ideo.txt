Tara Safaie
Tara Safaie is a Senior Business Development Associate in IDEO's Design for Change studio. She is particularly excited when tough strategic problems are manifested beautifully, and her role in BD allows her to help potential clients begin to navigate that journey. Educated at the College of William and Mary in Virginia, Tara changed course from her liberal arts roots to spend three years in consulting. Beauty and strategy now intersect in her role at IDEO.

When not writing proposals galore, you can find Tara behind a film-loaded camera, playing some volleyball, or climbing some rocks.
