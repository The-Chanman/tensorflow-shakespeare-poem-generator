Ben Appenzeller
Ben Appenzeller is a Business Designer in the Hatch studio at IDEO San Francisco. A steadfast entrepreneur and intrapreneur, he works with companies of various shapes and sizes to design innovative new experiences, business models and growth strategies. His approach combines quantitative analysis (the “what”), with qualitative research (the “why”) to craft solutions around strategic consumer insights. Ben's approach balances traditional business strategy with human insights from things like predictably irrational behavior and incentives-driven decision making.
Before joining IDEO, Ben was a Lead Product Marketing Manager at Uber, where he helped build a pilot loyalty program. He also ran experiments to optimize high-traffic user-funnels and worked closely with the design team on marcom and product UI and UX. Prior to that, Ben dabbled in a series of startups, including a social marketplace for food (Etsy for food) and a mobile gift card clearing house. He also brings 5 years of experience from various roles at American Express.
Ben holds an MBA from Columbia University and a B.S. in Economics, Finance, and Marketing from Washington University in St. Louis.
