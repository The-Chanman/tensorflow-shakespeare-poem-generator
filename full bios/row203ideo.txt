Vinh Pho
An optimist and Industrial Designer at IDEO, Vinh has been known to restore vintage motorcycles and surf the coast when he’s not designing to help the world.
Vinh is driven by human interaction and experiences which constantly influence his design principles and perspectives. He believes that design does not stop with the pure aesthetic, but influences the entire eco-system of branding, identity, sustainability, and loyalty.
An Industrial Design graduate from Art Center College of Design, Vinh also received a Certificate of Completion at Insead Business School in France where he learned that hard work and passion pay off.
Vinh’s strategic approach and provocative thinking have earned him The Dieline Packaging Award as well as multiple IDSA Awards in product design, interface design, and packaging/graphic design.
He cannot wait to work with you.
