Rachel Young
Rachel is a Design Lead at IDEO in San Francisco where she focuses on systems design and specializes in education. She thinks about how products, services, and programs work within broader ecosystems. Rachel has fifteen years of experience as a teacher, designer, storyteller, writer, and product manager in education. She's fascinated by digital behavior, the future of education, and small societal shifts that have a big impact.
In her last project, she helped design an interactive STEM learning experience that takes place entirely on a bus.
Previously, she oversaw the visual brand of the KIPP schools, a network of public charter schools in low income communities, and led external-facing work at the non-profit startup Character Lab, where she worked on branding, product development, and program design.
Once upon a time, she was a sixth grade teacher in East Palo Alto, one of the most economically challenged cities in California. Despite her passion for teaching, it was her hand-drawn posters that made her classroom a tour stop â€” probably an early indication that she would one day combine design and education. She's a longtime Bay Area resident recovering from a few years living in DC, and majored in political science, so she knows her way around policy.
The most complex and beautiful project to which she's ever contributed is her daughter, who is two years old. She lives with her daughter and husband in Oakland.
