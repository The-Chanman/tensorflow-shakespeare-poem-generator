Matthew Charette
As a Network Engineer for the Global Technology Team, based out of the Cambridge studio, Matt works to maintain and design the network infrastructure. With deep interests in wireless technologies and security, he works to keep IDEO's network stable and secure.
After stints at Methodist University and Western Kentucky University, he returned to New England to finish a BS in Physical Education at Bridgewater State University. Naturally, at this point he began his career in Information Technology. Prior to joining IDEO, he spent five years honing his craft at Compass Medical. Being thrown to the fire early has helped him quickly advance through hardened, valuable, experience.
Outside of work, he can be found crafting in his workshop, attempting an instrument he'll never learn, or planning which of the 50 states he will donate blood in next.
