Peter Slattery
Peter is a Game Designer on IDEO Palo Alto's Design for Play team, working to bring enriching digital experiences to the next generation of creative thinkers. Peter's love of teaching and camping have lead him to focus on creating experiences that transport audiences to faraway places, in the hope that the fantastical can teach us something about everyday life.Â 
Peter's work at IDEO has includes digital app development for preschoolers, multisensory virtual reality experiences for conceptual automotive design, and developing a virtual reality trip to Mars to build engagement with real science to low-income middle school students. Peter received a BFA in Illustration from Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) where he crafted a curriculum which drew connections between traditional design and computer science. The most important thing Peter learned at RISD was that the best thing a teacher can do is to teach you how to teach yourself.
In the past, Peter has designed games to teach color theory, reinforce a positive relationship with failure, and to engender empathy with the wheelchair bound. Prior to arrival at IDEO, Peter became an Eagle Scout, taught game design to 120 teenagers at an overnight summer camp, and got lost canoeing for two weeks in the Canadian Boundary waters.
