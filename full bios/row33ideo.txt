Fun facts

Originally hailing from the Netherlands, I also spent some years in Sweden, London and currently in San Francisco. Cycling is in my DNA, I am a street art lover (follow me on twitter), always can be found at live music events and am trying hard to improve my English American humor beyond making 'dad jokes'.
Side note

During my most recent work experience at LUNAR + McKinsey I worked on several projects involving Design team members (Researchers, Designers, Engineers) and Business Consultants.Â Within a broad range of projects involving food design, mobility, retail, packaging and consumer and professional products, the teams worked with clients in a new range of work collaborations. Throughout these past 2.5 years I was a core lead in evaluating and improving the opportunities and challenges within creating Impactful, Efficient and Successful projects, teams and processes.
