Derek Olson
In sixth grade, Derek Olson designed his first website for his own aspiring alt-rock cover band. In high school, he built and wrote software for internationally competing robots. Today, he continues to straddle the line between technology and creativity, fusing art and design with software, sensors, wires, and solder.
As a software designer at IDEO Chicago, Derek approaches design challenges with strong ideas about technology, processes, and what it means to make something real. Heâ€™s used iBeacons to build out an immersive, highly customized retail experience for a major home improvement brand, worked with Rise Science, a sleep-coaching startup, to simplify and evolve their app design, contributed to a new dashboard interface for a major American auto company, streamlined the complex college application process by prototyping a new mobile portal, and recently designed interfaces and workflows for both a new medical imaging device and robotic surgical platform.
Before joining IDEO, Derek was a software developer at various Chicago design firms, creating everything from micro-sites and ad-related content to large-scale interactive experiences for clients such as McDonald's and American Family Insurance, among others. His multi-touch, interactive music installations have been recognized by ACM SIGGRAPH and the Adobe Design Achievement Awards.
Derek holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Multimedia Design from the University of Wisconsin-Stout. His proudest moment: meeting Dean Kamen, founder of FIRST Robotics and inventor of the Segway.
