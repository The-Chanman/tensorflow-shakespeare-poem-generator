Bryan Walker
Bryan Yuji Walker is a Partner and Managing Director at IDEO San Francisco. He leads the Design for Change studio, helping leaders transform their organizations' cultures and businesses in pursuit of innovation, adaptability and impact.
An IDEO veteran, Bryan is curious about the future of work and how design can affect and support change within complex human systems. Together with his clients, he is exploring what corporate leaders can learn from entrepreneurs and venture capitalists; how technology, a new generation of employees, and a shifting marketplace is redefining the workplace experience; and how leaders can drive change by movement as opposed to mandates.
Bryan's work has been widely recognized and spans the consumer electronics, fashion, financial services, food and beverage, health care, hospitality, and retail industries. His design research for a baby stroller was awarded “product design of the year” by the Human Factors and Ergonomic Society and was later featured in the Smithsonian museum. His work has also been featured in BusinessWeek, Fast Company, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal.
He is a core design team member for the Aspen Institute's First Movers Fellowship Program and also lectures at Cornell University, Stanford University, UC Berkeley, and the California Center of Arts on the topics of design thinking, organizational design, consumer experience design, and service design.
Bryan earned a master's degree in social anthropology from Oxford University and a bachelor's degree in design and environmental analysis from Cornell. Outside the office, he can be found chasing the perfect wave.
