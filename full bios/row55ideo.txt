Meija Jacobs
Meija is a portfolio director in the Design for Food Studio at IDEO who creates ideas that matter to people - - not as “consumers,” but as human beings. With expertise in brand strategy and design research, Meija designs brands, services, products, and experiences for clients from non-profits to Fortune 500 companies - - from a cross-platform entertainment network to engage people in their health, to a pro-sex social movement to decrease unplanned pregnancy, to a service supporting NFL players' transition into post-football lives, and the production of a brand film series on beer-drinking and millennial nightlife around the world.
Prior to IDEO, Meija led award-winning advertising for brands like Lexus, as a director of brand strategy at Team One, including launching the world's first luxury hybrid vehicles and an industry-leading approach to marketing Certified Pre-Owned vehicles.
Meija holds an MA in Clinical Psychology and earned her BA in Psychology from Mount Holyoke College. Her work has been recognized by IDSA's IDEA, Drucker Institute, Cannes Lions, EFFIE, Jay Chiat Awards for Strategic Excellence, and Ogilvy Research. She is a teacher, writer, and speaker on design thinking.
Meija trained as a dancer for 15 years, so if she throws up some jazz hands, it's a good thing.
