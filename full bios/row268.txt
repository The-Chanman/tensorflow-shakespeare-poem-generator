Katie Kirsch
Katie Kirsch helps to lead marketing for IDEO's Palo Alto studio and is passionate about visual storytelling, youth and women's empowerment, and the design of impactful products and brands.
Prior to IDEO, Katie gained a BS degree in Product Design Engineering from Stanford University. At the Stanford d.school, she co-founded Girls Driving for a Difference: an organization empowering girls to become leaders of social change. Katie and her team road-tripped across the US for 14 weeks in an RV, teaching design thinking and leadership workshops for girls. Their curriculum now lives on as a Teaching Toolkit â€” a "workshop in a box" that enables a global community of educators to bring the workshop to communities of their own.
Outside of IDEO, Katie enjoys filmmaking, writing, yoga, and dance.
