George Joseph
George Joseph is a Senior Communication Designer at IDEO's education studio. He believes good design can empower people to solve complex challenges, and he uses a distinct visual skillset to bring clarity and simplicity to his work. In his time at IDEO, George has found a home in four of the firm's locations: Munich, Mumbai, Singapore, and now San Francisco. In that time, he has created a new brand vision for a global, multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical company, re-imagined farm equipment ownership in India, designed a new international school concept from scratch, and helped create a brand toolkit that influences IDEO's work globally.
George's deep love for collaboration is demonstrated through the way he designs systems that bring people together. He led the design of an initiative to create new solutions for the challenges associated with aging in Singapore, including all the aspects of a 2-day Make-a-thon that brought together experts in the field, the best of Singapore's creative community, and IDEO designers to build out concepts that inspire a new perspective on growing old. His love for iconography can be seen in every project he works on, including the IDEO studio, where his work forms the basis of the studio's visual expression.
George is enthusiastic about contributing his skills to the education sector, and wishes to someday take his bass guitar and his terrible puns to a much larger audience.
