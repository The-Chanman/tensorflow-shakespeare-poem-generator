Judy Hsu
Judy is a Sr. Design Researcher and Food Product Designer at IDEO. She is passionate about people—with a genuine desire to learn everything there is to know about how we as humans think, act and evolve. Her wish is to make lives better through empathetic, accessible design. A career researcher, Judy is a strong believer in the power of fusing both qualitative and quantitative-derived information to paint a holistic picture of the human experience. She maintains that the role of research in the design process is to inform and inspire.
Prior to joining IDEO, Judy was a researcher for the global information and measurement company Nielsen and later The Culinary Edge, a restaurant consulting firm based in San Francisco. Her client portfolio includes established brands such as Nestle, Procter & Gamble, Kraft, Starbucks and Subway, as well as up-and-coming brands such as LYFE Kitchen, El Pollo Loco, and McAlister’s Deli.
Judy holds degrees in Marketing and Decision Sciences from Miami University (OH). A self-admitted food fanatic, Judy also has a culinary degree from Kendall College (Chicago) and will gladly prepare for you a delicious multi-course meal, as long as you’re okay with her drafting up an elaborate Gantt chart to help plan it…
