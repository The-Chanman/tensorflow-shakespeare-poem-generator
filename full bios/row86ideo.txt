Nick Bruni
Nick is a designer with an ambition for making a positive impact on humanity. Spaces and experiences fascinate him, particularly memorable and intimate ones like those surrounding food. Growing up, Nick has worn many hats, designing pop-up furniture for mobile classrooms, transportation infrastructure for the VTA, sustainable beach houses in SoCal, a new office campus for Apple, and most recently as a researcher for a Mellon Foundation grant prototyping future models for interdisciplinary education. Designing for people has been the one constant connecting the dots of his past. Nick holds a recent Master of Architecture degree from UCLA and a Bachelors in Civil and Transportation Engineering from Santa Clara University. He loves Hockney, skateboarding through the city, playing the guitar, and a little disco every now and then.
