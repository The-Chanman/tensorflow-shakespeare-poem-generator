Stefanie Plursch
As an experience specialist with IDEO Munich, Stefanie is passionate about giving internal and external guests a warm welcome to the office and helping to make their stay a memorable one. She always strives to make sure that things run as smoothly as possible.
Steffi is taking care of visitor experiences, office decoration and event planning.
Being a Munich native, Steffi always knows the best lunch place, the ideal present or the coolest party location. She is able to react nimbly to changing demands and always finds a solution.
She particularly enjoys hosting and entertaining large groups of people, which she used to do professionally in the hospitality space before joining IDEO.
When she is not organizing a last minute lunch catering, she can be found building lamps or furniture in the office workshop or exploring the mountains around Munich with her family and friends.
