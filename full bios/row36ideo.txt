Marielos Sanson
Marielos Sansón is a Software Designer at IDEO, passionate about leveraging technology to create delightful and magical experiences. As part of the Design for Play team, Marielos strives to design experiences that use the power of Play to engage, build understanding and encourage mastery and growth. Her work at IDEO ranges from creating quick and simple prototypes to designing, developing and supporting production level applications. She has worked on projects across diverse industries including finance, travel and dining, entertainment, and mobility. 
Marielos has a special weakness for working with children. In particular, she loves getting the younger generations excited about STEM. Before IDEO, she was a presenter at CoderDojo, where she taught kids 6-12 beginners' programming and she started a STEM summer camp for middle schoolers in Nicaragua.
Marielos holds a BS in MS&E and an MS in Computer Science from Stanford University, where she first converted from a technology hater to a technology lover when she discovered the power of applying technology through a user-centered lens. Outside of work, Marielos loves traveling, learning new languages and Salsa dancing.
