Divya Viswanathan
Divya Viswanathan is a Senior Design Researcher at IDEO. She is naturally curious about people, their motivations and how they make decisions. As a researcher, she works with people to understand their explicit and implicit needs and helps articulate them in actionable ways. As a designer, she works as a problem solver â€“ bridging the gap between user and solution. Combining the two fields, she enjoys designing new ways of interacting with people through cultural probes and contextual inquiry.
Prior to IDEO, Divya was a User Experience Designer with Nokia Research Center in India. Her work has taken her across the world, looking at ways in which people are using and experiencing mobile technology. These insights and explorations lead to identifying relevant new areas for mobile services to play a meaningful role in the future. She focuses on crafting research methods that allow users to play a bigger role in the design process. Her projects include work on researching health care systems, education and literacy in emerging markets and personal security for women in urban contexts.
Divya has a background in Communication Design & Film making, from the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology. Her work has been showcased at Ars Electonica, Handheld Learning and CHI.
