Ian Groulx
Ian Groulx helps push brands to be brave and bold. As senior design director, Ian leads multidisciplinary teams that are exploring the edges of how brands create compelling conversations and build authentic connections with consumers.
Ian is focused on helping brands - - established and start-up - - capture and sustain market attention through designing powerful and engaging experiences. Under his creative leadership, Ian's team mobilized one multinational B2B electronics company to break its business model and establish a relationship with their end consumers. Ian partnered with a global fashion brand to redesign its customer journey as well as the role of its sales teams, creating a more meaningful brand for both employees and customers.
A graphic designer by training, Ian's work has spanned brand vision and strategy, visual identity systems, packaging, environmental graphics, and extensive print collateral systems. With this deep experience and a view to grow and cultivate talent at IDEO, he has passionately mentored designers over the past 15 years. 
Ian holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Western Michigan University in graphic design with a minor in printmaking. A creative problem-solver by nature, Ian is a staunch believer that one's best work comes when you're having fun. In his free time, you'll find Ian with his family, making art or at the grill, crafting a perfectly smoked pork shoulder.
