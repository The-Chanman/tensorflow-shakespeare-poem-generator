Benjamin Swire
Ben Swire is the Design Lead for writing at IDEO New York. He helps project teams shape their intuitive insights and complex ideas into clear, powerful and compelling work. Ben has employed storytelling techniques to help and inspire clients in media, government, civic innovation, financial empowerment, academia and scientific research. Because of his background in philosophy, Ben is particularly drawn to the obnoxious sort of questions that people don't usually consider to be questions - the sort of questions that try to uproot the obvious and explore what is hidden beneath.
Before joining IDEO, Ben was a Vice President of Strategic Marketing for Morgan Stanley where he became well-practiced in finding the essential value of complicated ideas and articulating that to experts and consumers alike. Prior to Morgan Stanley, Ben did graduate work in Marxist philosophy. (Beware God's affection for irony.)
