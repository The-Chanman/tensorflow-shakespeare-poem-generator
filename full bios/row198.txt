Ilya Prokopoff
More than a decade ago, Ilya Prokopoff noticed an emerging pattern about IDEO's clients. While many were still looking for innovative product, service, and experience designs, more and more were coming to IDEO looking for something intangible but essential: to build creative cultures from within their organizations. In response to this need, Ilya launched Organizational Design, a discreet group within IDEO dedicated to help leaders drive long-lasting change in their organizations. Built from IDEO's approach, this practice helps organizations understand their customers better and to operate in fundamentally human-centered ways.
Since that time, Ilya has worked with a long list of organizations that have profoundly changed the way they operate. Some of his work includes helping Kaiser Permanente and Mayo Clinic to build the capability for continuous innovation; helping the Gannett Corporation create new global products and services that redefine media corporation offerings; and building a joint design studio in Lima, Peru with Intercorp (one of the largest conglomerates in the country) to design world-class services for the rapidly growing middle class.
Ilya, who has been an IDEO partner since 2007, co-leads IDEO's San Francisco office and applies his methods and practice to foster creativity within its own walls.
Before joining IDEO, Ilya worked at Doblin, a boutique-consulting firm that blended management consulting and design. He holds a Bachelor's of Science in product design from the Institute of Design at the Illinois Institute of Technology.
