Gaetano Ling
Gaetano is a multidisciplinary maker with a strong passion for developing novel, human facing technologies. As a Product Designer at IDEO Palo Alto, he brings a mixture of mechatronics, material science, and industrial design to catalyze future facing ideas into tangible experiences.
Prior to joining IDEO, Gaetano was a large contributor to London's burgeoning hardware start-up community. He was one of the founding Design Engineers at ROLI, taking several pioneering musical instruments from hand sketched concepts to mass manufactured products that offer new forms of digital interaction and expression. Products he collaborated on include: the Seaboard GRAND, nammed the Design Museum's Product of the Year 2014, as well as the Seaboard RISE and BLOCKS, both recipients of CES innovation awards for connected devices in 2016 and 2017, respectively. He also contributed towards two patents in elastic materials and touch sensing during that time.
Gaetano earned a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Boston University and went on to work in the semi-conductor industry developing automated systems, robotics, and new materials for silicon wafer manufacturing. From there he went on to earn a double master's in Design Engineering from the Royal College of Art and Imperial College in London where he graduated in 2011 with distinction as “one of the top three tech talents in London” by the Evening Standard for his inventions in augmented reality and immersive interfaces for fine art museums.
Outside of IDEO, Gaetano is an avid maker and eater of ice cream.
