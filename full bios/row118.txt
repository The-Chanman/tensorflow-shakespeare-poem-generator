Dave Vondle
Dave Vondle is a designer and engineer of interactions. During his education he focused mostly on the interactions between technologies in the form of electronics and robotics. During this time he realized that the interest in designing interactions went beyond technology. At IDEO he has worked to create well crafted experiences by designing and facilitating their development.
Education: Dave graduated from Brown University with an Electrical Engineering degree. In order to satiate his creative interests, he took classes at Rhode Island School of Design in sculpture, ID and IaD. Prior to IDEO: Dave has been an intern at Design Lab, a toy invention firm as well as interactive exhibition firm, Tellart. Dave has also been a research assistant who helped train flying squirrels how to fly in a wind tunnel for a biological study on the evolution of mammalian flight.
Within IDEO: He has been working on bringing interactivity to prototypes, providing a conduit for feedback of interactions and experiences. As much of this is working with tangible user experiences, this has led him to work on developing information architectures and crafting experiences. Preferring to not stay put in one role, Dave moves between leading projects, coding, designing interfaces, building prototypes and designing circuits.
