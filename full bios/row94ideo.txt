Noreen’s work in the heady world of advertising, writing, and conceptualizing across a variety of media-- young and old, traditional and non, has taken her from the east to west coasts, and back again. From the cool shores of La Jolla, at American Heart Association and Jet Set Management, to the continental climate of Boston, at Mullen, to the arid hotness of Los Angeles, at Young & Rubicam Brands.
Following a stirring turn at the University of San Diego's Olin School of Business and then an extended period of time working and traveling throughout Australasia, Noreen earned her Master’s degree in Global Marketing Communication & Advertising at Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts. A southern California native, Noreen checks the Boston weather forecast hourly.
