Jenn Maer
Jenn’s career as a storyteller began at age seven when she penned (well, actually, penciled) her first novel—a 75-page, double-spaced, spiral notebook tour de force entitled “Shark!”
Since then, she’s worked as an agency Account Planner—conducting qualitative consumer research—as well as a Copywriter and Associate Creative Director. She’s helped tell the stories of clients like HP, Oregon Chai, Microsoft, Red Envelope, Snapple, and more. Her writing has been recognized by The One Show, Clios, John Caples International Awards, and the Bay Area Addys.
Today as a Portfolio Director in the Design for Change studio at IDEO, Jenn offers brand strategy, storytelling, and creative leadership to an equally diverse group of IDEO clients, including Marriott, Mattel, ConAgra, and The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. And she’s been lucky enough to work on projects that have grabbed the attention of the Spark Awards, ISDA IDEA awards, and Core 77 Design Awards.
Jenn is at her happiest when she's creating things that bypass the brain's radar and go straight to the heart. Speaking of which, I also teach IDEO U's course, Storytelling for Impact, where you can learn to do the same.
Jenn holds a BA in Women’s Studies (focused on Literature and Anthropology) from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts.
