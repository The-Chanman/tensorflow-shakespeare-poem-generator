As a Partner at IDEO, Danny serves as an Executive Design Director. With a background in fine art, visual communications and product design, Danny was drawn to the field of interaction design through his interests in visual design and time-based media. He loves working with interdisciplinary teams to shape how we interact with products and services and strives to make the world a better place through focusing on design excellence.
Danny's deep grounding in interaction design at IDEO richly intersects IDEO's transportation and mobility work. Working with many of the world's leading automotive manufacturers, Danny has helped shaped a variety of innovative Human-Machine Interface touch points for vehicles. He has helped design for vehicle-to-vehicle interactions, climate and ambience control, access approaches, gestural interactions, active heads up displays, personal device integration and a wide range of ownership, training and telematics services. Many of these engagements have been focused on enhancing safety and positively impacting our ecosystem at large.
Prior to joining IDEO, Danny taught interactive media courses in higher education and consulted as an interaction designer. Today he continues to mentor and learn from other design colleagues by working directly with them across a range of content areas. Danny also remains active in higher education through serving on several design school boards and by lecturing and teaching design modules.
