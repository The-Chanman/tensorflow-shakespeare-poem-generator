Kate Burn
Kate's fascinated by how the way we think, feel, act and interact is influenced by the design of the physical and virtual worlds around us. She gets hooked listening to people's stories and enjoys getting creative with design research methods – blending a diverse range of approaches to help teams and clients build empathy, look at challenges in new ways and unearth stories about what really makes people tick.
Kate's design research programmes inspire design opportunities that place people at the centre. She's happiest collaborating with teams to craft experiences that ultimately allow people get a bit more out of life. Since joining IDEO, Kate's worked on design challenges for sectors as diverse as mobility, healthcare, retail strategy & experiences, digital publishing, immersive campaign experiences, even international logistics!
Prior to joining IDEO, Kate worked in service design. Operating between the UK public/third sectors, she helped to design, develop and prototype a suite of innovative services which aimed to change people's lives and influence UK public policy. Her work supported people managing long term health conditions, helped people build the networking skills that can transform a life of joblessness to a fulfilling career, and connected older people with others in communities, to live more comfortably at home and combat isolation
When she's not at IDEO London, you can find Kate making music with all-woman dream-team DeepThroatChoir, finding some peace in the wilderness, or exploring a new corner of the world.
