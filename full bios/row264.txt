Kate Wakely
Kate is a senior design researcher at IDEO, where she's lucky enough to get to explore how the world is seen and experienced by people from all walks of life. Kate loves to listen to the stories people have to tell and use these to inspire the design process.
Kate believes good design is about transforming people's ability to get the most out of life, by addressing the smallest through to the most complex challenges we face. Kate spent 5 years working as a qualitative researcher before transitioning to focus on design research and service design 3 years ago. Since joining IDEO Kate has worked across a range of sectors; from helping Singapore's government to engage their citizens with healthcare insurance to designing a new customer experience for one of the UK's most iconic retailers.
While at the Royal College of Art, Kate collaborated with start up Cupris Health to look at potential primary and secondary healthcare applications of their smartphone-connected medical devices. She's also worked on designs to support self-care for type 2 Diabetes and explored how genetic data could be used in a quantified-self healthcare platform. 
Kate has a BA in Social Anthropology from the London School of Economics and an MA in Service Design from the Royal College of Art, where her final project was shortlisted as on of the Design Museum's Designs of the Year.
