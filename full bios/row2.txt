Aaron Wansch
Aaron Wansch is a Senior Industrial Designer at IDEO Palo Alto with a passion for human-centered design solutions and process-orientated product development. Aaron is motivated about immersing himself into relevant problem areas in order to reveal inherent user insights and develop beautifully-crafted, holistic solutions that encourage positive change and enhance the human experience.
Austrian-born, Aaron´s design career started at the age of eight, when he amazed his parents with elaborately crafted LEGO compositions and first wooden mockups. He later gained a BA in Design & Product Management from University of Applied Sciences Salzburg as well as a MFA in Advanced Product Design from top-ranked Umeå Institute of Design in Sweden.
With 4+ years of professional in-house & consultancy experience in Europe, Asia and the United States, Aaron has been fortunate enough to design product & brand experiences for various international clients. His work has been awarded with multiple Red Dot & iF Concept Design Awards, and been recognized in the International Design Excellence Awards and James Dyson Design Award. When not designing, Aaron loves to travel, explore the unknown, and cherishes the crackling sound of a needle touching a vinyl record anytime.
