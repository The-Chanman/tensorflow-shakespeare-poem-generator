Annie Svigals
As a Business Development Associate in IDEO's Design for Food studio, Annie Svigals marries her passion for food and design to help grow the food and beverage portfolio at IDEO San Francisco.
With a BA from Bates College in art history and visual arts, Annie utilizes her aesthetic sensibility and creativity to working with clients and internal design teams to develop programs that create aÂ positive impact on the future of food. She partners with clients like Whitewave Foods, Suntory Food & Beverage, and The J.M. Smucker Company as well as Bay Area food innovators to build projects and programs that produce better brands, products, and experiences. She believes that design is a powerful tool that can help drive our food system towards sustainable change.
Before focusing on building relationships for Design for Food at IDEO, Annie led Bay Area marketing at Good Eggs, an online grocery delivery startup on a mission to grow and sustain local food systems worldwide. She also worked in business development and marketing for an Oakland-based design firm that specializes in creating brand and web platforms for financial services and technology companies.
In her free time, you can find Annie behind a camera, playing some soccer, or shopping her local farmers market for the perfect cara cara orange.
