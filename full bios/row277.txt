Kim Cullen
Kim is a Senior Interaction Design Lead with 15 years of experience in visual communication, interface and system design. Kim strives to create products and services that are both useful and beautiful.
Kim has worked in a range of industries: from advertising to technology startups, public classrooms to art museums. Kim's extensive work with museums and exhibitions sparked her interest in the impact of design on human behavior in the physical world. She carried this experience to the digital realm, collaborating with engineers at several start-ups. Prior to IDEO Kim worked at Adaptive Path, leading UX teams to develop compelling physical and digital experiences in media, retail, healthcare and education.
Kim is also a faculty member in the undergraduate program in Interaction Design at the California College of the Arts. She is continually amazed, humbled and terrified by the ingenuity of her students.
A former elementary school teacher and a self-described typography nerd, her favorite hobby is teaching the people in her life to appreciate a good serif.
