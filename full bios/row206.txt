Jamie McCoy
The Shop Apprentice for IDEO Chicago, Jamie McCoy is a maker and doer who loves thinking with her head and her hands. A dedicated craftsperson who finds satisfaction in turning ideas into reality, Jamie has brought her meticulous build skills to bear on a variety of mediums ranging from fine metal jewelry to recycled paper wallets, bespoke boots to custom furniture. Outside of the workshop and prior to IDEO, Jamie's insatiable curiosity about human behavior found a home at More Than Words, a non-profit where she taught at-risk youth practical job skills to help them thrive. Jamie received her bachelor's from Dartmouth in Art and Psychology, followed by a year-long intensive at North Bennet Street School's cabinet and furniture-making program. These days, Jamie's expanding her skill set by going to live storytelling events like The Moth, learning improv at Second City, and by training for a Tough Mudder race. Her fine-motor skills are offset by a terrible sense of direction.
