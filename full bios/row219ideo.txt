Zachary Hobbs
Zach Hobbs is a Communication Designer at IDEO Chicago who brings unfettered creativity, white-hot optimism, and insatiable curiosity to bear on any design problem, large or small. Since joining IDEO, Zach has helped a major American food company bring a new brand to life, a leading welding-equipment company create a more user-friendly interface, and a Midwest energy company encourage its customers to conserve energy, among other challenges.
Before moving “up North” from his native Alabama, Zach was the Art Director of TrueBlue and the Founder and Principal Art Director of Young Monster, a custom screen-printing company. His work at both places was featured in publications ranging from ‘zines to the New Masters of Poster Design and he racked up so many Gold Addys, AIGA, and Print Regional Design Awards, it’s kind of embarrassing. Before that, Zach was earning a BFA in Graphic Design from Auburn University.
On weekends, Zach can be spotted combing through vintage stores for anything to do with punk rock, UFOs, the year 1987, and any general, pre-Internet ephemera. He is very, very tall.
