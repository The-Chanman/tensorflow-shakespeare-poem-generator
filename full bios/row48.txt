Born and brought up in India, she moved to London in 2005 for an MSc in Media and Gender from the LSE, and also has a Masters in English Literature from St. Stephens College, Delhi.
Always up for a new adventure, Arunima has also lived in Dubai and Cape Town. A yearning novelist at heart, she's had some success with non-fiction, and has a chapter “The Guide to Co-creation” in the Definitive Book of Branding. Apart from this, she's mostly thinking about feminism, ice cream and dogs.
