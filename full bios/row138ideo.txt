Samantha Miller
Sam is a Design Researcher at IDEO London. She is interested in telling engaging stories to inspire design grounded in real-world experiences and behaviors, often using photography and film. Experimenting with research methods for design, she enjoys seeing how new technologies can push the boundaries of the design research discipline. Her prior work has taken her across a wide range of projects, from research on the 'super-material' graphene to the future of hands-free communication, and has been presented at the Microsoft Research Design Expo, Seattle and at Waterman's Art Centre, London.
Sam holds a Masters in Interaction Design Research from Goldsmiths College, University of London, where she learned a playful and experimental approach to design research led by the Interaction Research Studio. Prior to that, she studied Sociology at New York University.
