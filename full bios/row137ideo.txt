Sam Starr
Sam has been a product designer with IDEO since 2014, where he's focused his inclination for wild ideas and a hands-on approach to a variety of projects in fields ranging from toys to transportation to healthcare. He'll often inject a 'build to think' mentality into the creative process of his teams, bringing ideas into physical form as early as possible. Sam's skills are broad- he enjoys contributing to projects from the early stages of design ethnography to ideation, prototyping and ultimately to the craft of storytelling. The best work in Sam's portfolio has materialized when client collaboration is consistently strong throughout a project timeline; facilitating that level of partnership is part of what makes design consulting at IDEO so rewarding for Sam.
Sam comes from an eclectic background with roots in the Stanford Graduate Design Program where David Kelley was his mentor in the midst of a curriculum of Art, Engineering, and Design Methodology. His thesis focused on the role of design in the future of mental healthcare. As a designer focused on 'making', Sam was also shaped by experiences earlier in his career renovating historic homes, building and operating a neapolitan pizza food truck and creating installation Art. Sam also tries to maintain a strong spirit of adventure; in past lives he's raced road bicycles professionally in Spain and sailed across the Atlantic.
