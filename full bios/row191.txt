Previously, Heather was Associate Editor at the non-profit environmental law firm Earthjustice. She developed magazine features, infographics, and blog series; oversaw front- and back-of-the-book production; and established the firm's first fact-checking program.
In January 2013, Heather joined healthline.com's inaugural news team, managing a four-person, bicoastal news desk covering healthcare policy and the latest medical research. She set the daily calendar, developed editorial strategy, and tracked analytics.

As an editor, Heather has worked one-on-one with authors to hone stories on data hacking, medicinal marijuana, and more. As a writer, she's crafted articles about acres of oozing algae in Florida, civil rights abuses on North Carolina factory farms, the art of Japanese butoh, and the ancient history of cheese.
Heather's work has appeared in numerous publications, including VIA magazine, The New Internationalist, Diablo magazine, and T: The New York Times Style Magazine.
Heather graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Berkeley.
A jewelry maker, photographer, and amateur archaeologist, Heather can often be found on the lam with her camera or biking through San Francisco en route to the California Academy of Sciences.
