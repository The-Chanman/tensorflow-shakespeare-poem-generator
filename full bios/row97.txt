Christopher Scott
Christopher Scott is a Global Operations Technical Lead based out of IDEO's Cambridge, MA studio. He is part of the team that oversees all technical systems used throughout the company. Chris brings more than 15 years of creative agency infrastructure management experience to IDEO.
Chris' former work experience has covered the gamut - - starting with a Bachelor of Science in Business Systems Analysis from Purdue University, he entered the workforce just as the Web broke in the early 1990s. His career has navigated him through stints focusing on large-scale data processing to web site development to app development to managing all of the technical needs of some of Boston's better-known SMB advertising agencies.
Chris keeps himself active in varied extracurricular activities from trying to learn how to play flamenco guitar to skiing to tinkering with homebrew home media systems. He's a hopeless Star Wars nerd, an electric guitar collector and a podcaster (he founded and runs Geek Tangent ). When he's not doing any of those other things, Chris is either plotting his next travel adventure or spending time with his wife and their two Pit Bulls.
