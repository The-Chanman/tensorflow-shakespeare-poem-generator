A Senior Talent Lead at IDEO, Megan Weibler is passionate about finding where the human element in recruiting, human resources, and learning and development strategically intersect. For over 10 years, Megan has taken a holistic, collaborative, and hands-on approach to finding and nurturing some of the brightest talents in design. Whether it's successfully creating a recruiting process that attracts the right talent, or implementing a new leadership model, Megan believes making people feel valued and supported in their careers leads to happier, more engaged employees.
Currently, Megan is leading a recruiting project in close collaboration with IDEO's Global Talent team. The focus is on building global best practices, shifting to a proactive recruiting platform that focuses on relationships, and creating a strong, transparent recruiting brand. Before this, Megan was prototyping different recruiting engagements such as a two-week micro-internship program calledFortnight to attract a more diverse and non-traditional talent pool,

She received her Bachelor's in Psychology from DePaul University and her Master's in Counselling Psychology from Adler University where she focused on Individual Psychology, specifically, how a person finds value and purpose in life and work by feeling part of a community.
When Megan's not trying to convince gifted designers to join IDEO, she's coaxing her three adorable daughters to eat more vegetables.
