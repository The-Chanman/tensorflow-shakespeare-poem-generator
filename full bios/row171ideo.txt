Steven Moore
Steve Moore is a Design Director at IDEO. He is passionate about pushing the boundaries of what “it” can be, always questioning the “why” and generating new thought provoking products and experiences that enhance and benefit our lives.
For more than a decade he has designed and innovated across many industries including consumer products (Dyson), FMCG, automotive, medical, airline, office furniture and in the toy industry. With a strong inventive mind he holds numerous patents ranging from fold up strollers, childrens scooters and dental products. His toy designs and inventions have won the Mattel Toy of the year award numerous times and has even been nominated for a TOTY (Toy of the year award), regarded as the Oscars of the toy industry.
As a Product Designer at IDEO, Steve has experience in all areas of generating and bringing a concept to market, from cradle to grave. Being a big advocate of building to think, he is particularly skilled at quickly turning ideas into something tangible through a vast array of prototyping techniques. Steve has been a visiting lecturer at Stanford and San Jose State universities on such topics.
Born just outside London in the UK, Steve has a BEng in Product Design and Manufacture from Loughborough University and an MA (RCA) in Industrial Design from the Royal College of Art in London, England.
Outside of design and invention efforts Steve is big lover of trekking (recently trekked to Everest base camp in Nepal), mountain biking, road cycling, snowboarding, creating public art pieces and travelling the world!
