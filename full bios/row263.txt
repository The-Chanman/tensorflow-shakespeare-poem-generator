Kate Schnippering
Kate Schnippering is a Software Design Lead at IDEO. She planned for life by reading science fiction novels, and accordingly specialized in translating between robots and humans. Kate is interested in how technology can heighten a user’s connection to the real world - through immersion that may eliminate screens and traditional experiences.
At IDEO, Kate’s work ranges from teaching Martian rover engineering to middle schoolers, to creating interfaces to experimental hardware in self-driving cars, to collaborating with extended engineering teams on complex systems design+implementation. Kate came to IDEO by way of crafting guitar-integrated mobile apps and natural language MI6-agent chatbots.
Kate has a B.A. in Computer Science and Studio Art from Dartmouth College, where she first began tinkering with paper, wire and electronics to build interactive peacock sculptures. Her spare time is spent among tall snowy mountains.
