Trent Huon
As a director for business design at IDEO Munich, Trent’s primary aim is to make the abstract real, transforming what begins as an idea into a tangible product or service. Working with project teams across disciplines to construct new business offerings, he begins by acquiring a deep understanding of a client’s core business, then integrating this insight with the teams’ ideas and his own strategies for market viability. Trent is especially passionate about integrating technology into new business solutions, specifically in imagining alternative uses for technology or creating technology that people can easily adapt to use in their own way.
Trent originally studied optometry at the University of New South Wales, mainly as an attempt to earn enough money to support his music career. Failing to become a rock star he headed for Ghana, where he managed an optical center for an NGO. He went on to work with health ministries across West Africa to set up profit-making optical centers in government-run hospitals. Based on this experience he came to believe that business and private enterprise hold the key to development, so he undertook an MBA program at St. Gallen University in Switzerland, later working as a management consultant at Monitor Consulting Group in Munich.
Trent has recently decided to try his hand at music again and is currently playing bass for a rock band in Munich.
