Owen Sanderson
Owen Sanderson is a Business Designer at IDEO Cambridge. There he helps startups and corporates alike build products, brands, and ultimately, new ventures. Owen brings deep experience in business and operations strategy with a strong international perspective. He thrives when building and testing scrappy prototypes and business models in the field.
Before joining IDEO Cambridge, Owen worked for IDEO.org in New York City – IDEO’s nonprofit design cousin. At IDEO.org he helped social entrepreneurs in East Africa craft their value propositions, surface new revenue streams, and scale their enterprises. Ask Owen about redesigning Kenya’s dairy sector, developing a chatbot to help off-grid farmers, or reimagining primary education in one of the world’s largest refugee camps.
Owen started his career in Washington, D.C. where he worked for Deloitte Consulting and a foreign policy think tank. Past clients have included Boeing, the U.S. State Department, and VISA.
Owen holds a Master’s in International Development from Tufts University and a Bachelor’s in Government from Georgetown University. Born in the Berkshires, skiing runs in Owen’s blood – and he can be found mountainside much of the winter. In the summer, he is happiest when near a rocky coastline, preferably in Portland alongside his wife from Maine.
