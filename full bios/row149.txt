Erika Lee
Erika Lee is a Senior Communication Designer at IDEO New York. Her work focuses on visual communication, helping organizations make abstract thinking tangible through visual solutions and storytelling that connect them to deeper understanding of people’s needs and bring new experiences to life. Her projects have included building digital and physical prototypes for a retail store, creating a digital experience for a cult-like fitness brand, and envisioning the future online apartment search experience.
Prior to joining IDEO, Erika worked as an independent Graphic Designer and Art Director in NY. She tackled a wide range of projects—from branding and identity systems, to motion graphics, to print, interactive and environmental design, and illustrations—for design firms like Pentagram to institutions like The New York Times. Erika received a BFA in Communication Design from Pratt Institute with a minor in Art History.
Outside of work, Erika spends her time eating all of New York, taking dance classes, binging on shows and films, and when weather permits, you can find Erika biking or running around NY (training for her third triathlon).
