Andrea Cevenini
Andrea is a communication designer in IDEO’s Munich studio. Drawing on his vast experience across design disciplines, Andrea’s core expertise lies in making ideas tangible through the creation of striking visual representations. Through the use of video, photography, animation, data visualization, and illustration, Andrea applies his compelling visual language to add beauty and meaning to the storytelling and design process.
Often blurring the lines between communication and interaction design, Andrea works with project teams throughout the life of a project to bring a coherence to concepts and ease the process of communication. He also brings a deep understanding of digital research methods to the initial project phase, and is committed to integrating qualitative and quantitative methods into IDEO’s research process.
Prior to IDEO, Andrea held a number of internships in the contemporary art, fashion, and music industries, taking him to Dusseldorf, Milan and Paris. He studied communication design at the Politecnico di Milano, and took part in the Master’s in European Design program (MEDES) at Politecnico, ENSCI in Paris and the Köln International School of Design.
For a time, Andrea thought of pursuing a career in fashion photography, before deciding a focus on design would have more impact on people’s lives. Today he still loves to take pictures, though, and is especially fond of the filtered world of Instagram
