Zubin Pastakia
Zubin is an interaction and service designer whose strength is his multi-disciplinary approach to different design challenges and a willingness to explore new content areas.
With a background that spans the social sciences, media production and interaction design, Zubin is comfortable contributing to all stages of the design process. He is particularly interested in human-centered research methods, concept generation and development, time-based prototyping, graphical user interface (GUI), tangible user interface (TUI) design, and creating compelling narratives with video to achieve proof of concept and communicate value.
Some recent projects include: designing the experience of an in-car messaging service with Volvo, generating concepts for new digital grieving practices, a tangible music player that allows users to scrub through one's listening-history (shortlisted for the IXDA Interaction Awards '13) , concepting a platform to smoothen the transition phase for people freshly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes with Novo Nordisk and designing solutions for improving local governance in Mumbai (shortlisted for the IXDA Interaction Awards '14).
Zubin has a Masters in interaction design from the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design (CIID) in Denmark. Earlier, he completed his undergraduate education in development economics at Bard College in the United States and studied filmmaking at NYU in 2004. In 2009, he spent a year at the Centre for the Study of Culture and Society (CSCS) in Bangalore studying cultural theory. In addition to design, Zubin as worked in film and documentary photography.
To unwind, Zubin likes to spend my time tinkering with music. He is currently fascinated by analogue synthesizers and â€™80s new wave bands.
