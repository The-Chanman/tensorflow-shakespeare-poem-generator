Thomas Junk
As a portfolio director with IDEO’s Munich studio, Tommi’s primary aim is to ensure that innovation happens, and that abstract and complex design challenges result in tangible results for both the client and end user. He believes this goal is best accomplished by developing a deep understanding of a client’s culture and processes and consistently working with the client in a process of co-creation, all the while contributing his own in-depth knowledge of industrial and complex stakeholder ecosystems. Tommi is particularly interested in helping B2B clients embrace innovation so as to help them maintain their relevance in the future.
While at IDEO, Tommi has worked with a diverse range of clients, including companies from the automotive, healthcare, financial and B2B industries. He holds a number of product patents, including innovations in dental care and plastics.
Prior to IDEO, Tommi worked as an industrial design freelancer in the consumer design industry and as a mechanical engineer freelancer, specializing in food industry production machines. He studied industrial design at the University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt and mechanical engineering at the University of Applied Sciences Trier.
Tommi’s passion for design endures outside of the office as well, and he loves finding the time to make furniture, weld, or work on lathe and milling machines. Otherwise he’s to be found in the kitchen, making use of his vast collection of Japanese knives.
