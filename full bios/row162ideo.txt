Sina Mossayeb
Sina Mossayeb is a global System Design Lead at IDEO with a focus on social impact and organizational change - - starting with a human centered strategy to rolling out products into the world. Bringing an interdisciplinary outlook from the social sciences through a human centered lens, Sina spends lots of time looking at the bigger picture and casting smaller frames to make connections between key points that have impact. Sina's focus on social and collective behavior within various organization types and across an array of industries brings a cross-pollinating element to his innovation design work. He worked on developing a framework for designing movements, and continues to advise IDEO projects related to movement and campaign design.
At IDEO, Sina has helped organizations re-imagine themselves in the future, as well as innovate leadership and new initiatives. He has also spent a considerable amount of time working with IDEO's education portfolio in thinking about systems level challenges. Recently, he co-founded an innovation studio with IDEO in Peru called La Victoria Lab (which addresses a portfolio of 28 companies). As a result he is also interested in work related to designing for ventures, innovation labs, and intrapreneurship.
Prior to IDEO, Sina worked as a director of innovation, researcher and university lecturer, and practitioner across the education, development, and government sector. He received a B.A. from UCLA and a Ph.D at Columbia University. Also, he ran through Tough Mudder (probably the toughest event on the planet) and survived.
