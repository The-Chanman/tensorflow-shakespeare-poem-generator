Kim Quan
Kim Quan is a Director at IDEO Shanghai and is a member of the location leadership team. She is passionate about unlocking the human potential of organisations and believes that no new idea can be executed and have impact without the right organisation behind it. Â 
She uses creativity and systems thinking to answer questions such as: How do you design an organisation to drive change in service of all stakeholders? What behaviours should organisations strive for to deliver massive change? To design simple and human organisations, Kim combines her experience in strategy and understanding human behaviour to design the behaviours, commitments, and capabilities required to make change happen.
Before joining IDEO, Kim worked in the US leading transformation engagements with The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), AT&T, and IBM. She has also worked as a behavioural researcher seeking to understand why people do the things that they do. She has studied the lived experiences of moms and dads, patients, employees, small business owners, friends, and users for clients such as Goldman Sachs, Genentech (Roche), The Wall Street Journal, American Express, Pfizer, and Target.
Kim has now made Shanghai her home. When she's not working, you can find her using her observation skills to better understand this new world - - the culture, the people, and especially, the food.
