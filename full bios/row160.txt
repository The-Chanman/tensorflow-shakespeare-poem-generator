Florian Gerlach
Blame it on growing up in the shadow of the Alps, but Florian Gerlach strives for purity and clarity of expression in all his industrial designs. From pendant lights to medical devices and wine glasses to electric bicycles, all of his work begins with a sensitive understanding of the needs of the people who will be using them everyday.
Before moving to Chicago to work at IDEO, Florian helped design medical and consumer products at Lunar Europe and developed a next-generation entrance area for Internorm, an Austrian manufacturer. He interned at T-Systems, a B-to-B communication technology company in Frankfurt, and his work has been exhibited in Germany and featured in several European design magazines.
Florian’s educational pursuits have taken him throughout Western Europe: from the Technical University Darmstadt for Mechanical Engineering to the University of Art and Industrial design in Linz, Austria, and the Politecnico di Milano in Italy.
The Alps are also responsible for Florian’s love of sports. He holds skiing and tennis-instructor licenses and loves to cycle and experiment with new exercise techniques. On rainy days, you can find him exploring furniture and lighting design exhibitions for inspiration.
