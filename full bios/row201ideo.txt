Vanessa Monogioudis
As a design researcher and design lead in IDEO’s Munich studio, Vanessa delights in the challenge of finding human centered design solutions to enrich people’s lives. Frequently drawing on her background in social and organizational psychology, her primary role at IDEO focuses on engaging with people to uncover their cognitive, physical, social and cultural needs.
While at IDEO, Vanessa has traveled extensively, meeting people from around the world while nurturing her own passion for documenting and collecting stories about people. The insights from these observations are used to help identify and shape design opportunities for clients. Recent projects have ranged from working with a client in the financial industry to discover people’s money and financial security needs, to helping an automotive company to develop a human-centered view of driver assistance systems.
Prior to IDEO, Vanessa worked as a research analyst and consultant for the Institute for Brand Development in Graz, Austria and as a psychological diagnostics specialist at a personnel consultancy. She graduated from the Institution of Higher Education for Art & Design in Graz, and holds a master’s degree in psychology from Karl-Franzens-University Graz.
A researcher by nature, Vanessa’s life is driven by a desire to listen to people, observe the world and document new discoveries, camera in hand.
