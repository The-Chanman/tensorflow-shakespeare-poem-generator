Luuk Rombouts
Luuk, an interaction designer at IDEO London, is interested in creating intelligent products and systems that work well within both their digital and physical space. His technological background allows him to prototype interactions and quickly test them in short iterative cycles.
Educated in Industrial Design at Eindhoven's University of Technology and the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design, Luuk has worked for a variety of agencies and startups, from game design (apps with 7M+ downloads) to marketing and speculative design. His work has been shown in Motherboard, Der Spiegel and several exhibitions around Europe.
