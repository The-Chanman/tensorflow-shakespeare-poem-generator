Sophy Lee
Sophy Lee is a Communication Designer at IDEO Cambridge, where she brings together her skills in graphic design, art direction, conceptual thinking, and craft. If you ever happen upon one of Sophy’s Moleskine notebooks, you’ll see that she loves to step away from the computer and find her design inspiration from tangible, personal exploration – pen-and-ink illustration, watercolors, and photography. Ultimately, her poetic investigations find their way into highly refined typography and visual communications of all kinds.
At IDEO, Sophy has worked in industries ranging from pharmaceutical to food services, financial to non-profit, focusing on visual identity to create powerful narratives. For some clients, she has used watercolors to enhance the packaging of their products; for others, she has relied on bold graphics to capture users’ attention. She brings versatility and a perceptive eye to the design needs of every IDEO client.
Before coming to IDEO, she worked for Weiden+Kennedy creating graphics for a broad range of industries, including Nike, Target and Heineken. As a senior designer for ESPN magazine, she created bold, harmonious infographics enhanced by photographs and typography. Sophy has also had in-house experience in fashion industries: the Polo.com division of Ralph Lauren and Kate Spade.
Born in South Korea, Sophy spent her early years in New Zealand, playing the cello and exploring nature with her sketchpad and camera. She traded in her idyllic childhood for a BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, followed by an MFA in the “Designer as Author and Entrepreneur” program at the School of Visual Arts in NYC. Currently residing in Cambridge with her husband and two young sons. Weekends are spent finding inspiration in museums or nature, and delighting in the world as seen through her children’s innocent eyes.
