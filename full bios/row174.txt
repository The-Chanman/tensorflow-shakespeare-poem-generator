Gian Pangaro
Gian Pangaro is a Senior Design Director for IDEO’s Boston, New York, and Chicago region. He works across teams, connecting people & projects to make IDEO’s work better and evolve the creative process. Most days, Gian lurks at the intersection of strategy, design, and storytelling, helping to ensure that we’re doing the right thing, doing it well, and communicating it clearly.
Gian joined IDEO in Palo Alto in 2003 as an Interaction Designer and Design Strategist. Moving to Boston in 2005, he helped build and develop Boston’s Interaction Design team to tackle analog and digital challenges across software, hardware, data, and storytelling. He and the Boston team create immersive physical and digital prototypes that bring experiences to life, enabling people to put themselves into the story of using a product.
In his 10+ years at IDEO, Gian’s clients have ranged from pharmaceutical to financial, municipal to federal, automotive to aviatic, educational to industrial. Throughout, Gian’s passion has been focusing strategy into interactive experiences through tangible outputs.
Gian holds a BA in Sociology from Harvard University, where he studied ethnography, electronics, and music. He earned an MS from the MIT Media Lab, where he studied Human-Computer Interaction and built hardware-software interfaces for Tangible Computing. In a parallel life, Gian is an active musician in the Boston area. He also builds, repairs, and restores musical instruments in his cramped but well-equipped basement shop.
