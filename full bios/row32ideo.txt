Maggie Peng
Maggie is a Design Lead and environments designer at IDEO, Shanghai. She uses a human centered approach to help clients understand and create meaningful spaces for their organizations. She works in a variety of scales, from urban visions to product and furniture design and brings a holistic approach from micro to macro and back again. She thrives in design thinking and is a believer in the power of design to ignite innovation and problem solve some of the most challenging questions we face.
Prior to joining IDEO, Maggie worked at architecture firms in Shanghai designing commercial mixed-use, corporate HQ campus, retail, cultural and educational buildings. Some of her clients include Poly, LaChapelle, Suning, Nike, City of Zaozhuang, Karamay School of Engineering, Karamay Houbo Medical School Campus. Prior to her relocation to Shanghai, Maggie headed an architecture/interior design agency in NYC where she created exhibition environments for many art galleries and retail environments for fashion brands such as Sigerson Morrison, Loeffler Randall, and United Bamboo. Her work often times creates or re-appropriates systems of design intelligence into flexible, multi-functional, and adaptive spaces.
Her interest in art and music has led her to work with artists on sculptures, installations, videos, and fragrance. These collaborations are intrinsic to her process of crafting conceptual stories and relationships into objects and environments.
She grew up between Taipei and California, where she received a Master of Architecture degree from UC Berkeley and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Environmental Studies / Art History from UC Santa Cruz. In her spare time, Maggie can be found making up stories, games and songs to entertain her daughters.
