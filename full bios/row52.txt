Hey there IDEO!
I'm the new guy working with the IDEO U team brought on to help create awesome customer experiences within our wonderful community of online learners! I couldn't be happier to be here. I'm new to the city, well any city really (from the suburbs of Southern California) and enjoy rock climbing and Harry Potter movies most of all -- on occasion, you may find me playing World of Warcraft or Hearthstone too (neither at work, of course)!
I'm fun and just LOVE being around people, you'll usually find me wearing bright colors or dancing around the office (sort of kidding about the second part). I can't wait to get to know you all over the next couple years and couldn't be more excited to be a part of the IDEO U team.
