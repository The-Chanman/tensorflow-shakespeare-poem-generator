Diana Rhoten
Diana is an Associate Partner based in IDEO's NY office. She works with organizations to reimagine who they are, what they do, and how they do it. Drawn to big challenges, she actively helps IDEO and its clients effect change at scale through the design of new offerings, ventures, and partnerships.
Diana has worked in and across business, government, and philanthropy, exploring the potential for organizations to innovate with both social and economic impact. Toward this end, she has helped R&D labs discover the power of interdisciplinary collaboration to generate breakthrough solutions in sustainability. She has helped catalyze new education markets by creating partnerships to accelerate startups building digital learning solutions as well as networks to support schools and non-profits seeking to adopt them. She has also designed and launched new entities within large-scale organizations as diverse as corporations like News Corp and government agencies such as the National Science Foundation.
Today, Diana is thinking hard about questions like: What are the shifting roles of business, government, and philanthropy in society? How might brands create new offers and experiences that inspire broader social change? How might we design purpose-driven platforms and networks to scale such change more effectively? What might current trends in "work" mean for future workforce products and workplace experiences?
Diana graduated from Brown (A.B.), Harvard (M.Ed.), and Stanford (Ph.D., M.A.). Outside the office, she can be found chasing her Great Danes in the park, fresh powder on the slopes, and her perennial dream to return to South America and Southern Africa.
