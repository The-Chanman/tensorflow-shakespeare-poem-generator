Jen Panasik
Jen Panasik is a Managing Director at IDEO San Francisco. She provides senior creative leadership to more than 50 designers across service, brand, product, media, and technology projects as they build solutions that help organizations shift within or disrupt the market.
With a particular interest in helping people discover and share the content they love, Jen defines the programming for media and technology projects that create new offerings, products, and services that help clients stretch outside of their core capabilities in rapidly changing landscapes. Her work spans digital delivery platforms, new technology ventures, experience design, service design, content development and branded environments. With a background in interaction design, she brings a human-centered narrative to a broad spectrum of work, including streaming media, immersive storytelling, data-driven technology and the fan experience.
Before IDEO, she worked on graphic and interaction design projects for the United Nations, TED, and Dwell magazine. As a senior visual designer at Organic, Inc., Jen led projects for Sony PlayStation and Lucy Activewear.
Jen currently serves on the FandangoLabs Advisory Board. She received a Master of Fine Arts in Design & Technology from New York's Parsons School of Design and a Bachelor's degree in English and minor in Graphic Communication from California Polytechnic in San Luis Obispo, California. Jen has a special interest in the number nine, interior design, and she's trying to rid the world of two spaces after a period.
