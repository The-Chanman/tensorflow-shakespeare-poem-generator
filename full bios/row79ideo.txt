Nadine Stares
Nadine Stares is the senior business development lead for IDEO in Europe. She works closely with clients who are new to design thinking to understand their business challenges and partners with the design community to demonstrate the impact our approach can have for their organisation.
With a background in the study of social anthropology at Sussex and then the history of design at the Royal College of Art, exploring latent human needs and desires and design's role in relation to these has been a longstanding fascination.
Before joining IDEO, Nadine worked in museums creating design exhibitions at MoMA and the V&A, on topics ranging from competing visions of modernity in the material culture of the Cold War era to the role that designers play today in translating disruptive scientific and technological innovations into objects and systems for everyday use - which, naturally, included works by IDEO.
Her move away from the ivory tower to the commercial sector was driven by a firm belief in designâ€™s ability to effect meaningful change when applied to real challenges out in the world.
