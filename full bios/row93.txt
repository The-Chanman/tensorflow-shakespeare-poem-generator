Chris Meierling
Chris is passionate about uncovering new value through human understanding. As a Human Factors Specialist at IDEO San Francisco, he collaborates with teams to ensure action is grounded in insight and driven by inspiration.
His approach to research pulls from cultural anthropology, planning, and design to drive at underlying opportunities for new products, services, and systems. In addition to uncovering latent consumer needs, he is motivated by convening stakeholders around complex challenges and building empathy. He has applied his work in a variety of contexts including product development, branding, education and public policy and is delighted by the opportunity to always learn something new.
Prior to joining IDEO, Chris was a Program Strategist at Arizona State University's Office of the President where he built university partnership programs and engaged in creative direction for university brand initiatives. He holds a masters degree (MSD) in design research from Arizona State University and a bachelors degree (BSD) in product design from The Ohio State University. He is also certified by The National Charrette Institute in charrette design for community planning and has studied interaction design at Kunsthchschule Wei√üensee in Berlin, Germany.
