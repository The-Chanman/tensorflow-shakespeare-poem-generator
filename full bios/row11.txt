Alex Grishaver
Alex Grishaver leads IDEO's Digital Shop, a motley crew of designers who rapidly prototype consumer products and services. Alex and team bring their expertise in mechanical and electrical engineering as well as software development to design work, always starting from a deep understanding of human behavior and a desire to humanize technology. He's been a mentor at Code for America and has contributed to the White House Innovation for Disaster Response and Recovery Initiative Demo Day and the Red Cross Strengthening Urban Resilience Through Technology Summit.
Alex joined IDEO in 1997 and, since then, he has served in various capacities, from working as an interaction designer during the first dotcom bubble to managing the firm's longterm relationship with HBO. In 2006, Alex's team partnered with Hakuhodo on a strategic project for Tokyo Metro in Japan; the project's success kick-started IDEO's relationship with the prestigious brand-marketing agency. Alex went on to work with other clients in Asia, including China-based TCL and South Korea's LG and GS Home Shopping, while helping build IDEO's portfolio of digital work.
Before coming to IDEO, Alex oversaw user research efforts at the online health and wellness startup. He also worked as an art director, illustrator, and designer for newspapers before earning his Master's in product design at the Institute of Design in Chicago where he explored the relationship between people and the built environment, studying the commuter experience in Chicago's elevated trains and designing products for public high school teachers.
Perhaps most important to his design career at IDEO: Alex interned at McDonald's, where he flipped burgers, ate well and brought human-centered design to fast food: observing workers to develop training materials based on their mental models of cooking.
