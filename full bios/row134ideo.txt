Sally Spinks
Sally Spinks, Design Director (Organisational Design) for IDEO London, has always been fascinated by group behaviours and how they change and shift, particularly in an organisational context. She's passionate about designing employee experiences to mirror the customer experience that enable employees to deliver on the organisation's purpose. She works with clients to gain insights into the unwritten rules of an organisation - how things really work. Then utilising human centred design, will develop a set of prototypes around internal organisational factors that will enable successful implementation of the project as well as broader cultural shifts. Clients range from IKEA, Sara Lee, a UK High Street bank and hotel chains through to small not-for-profit organisations.
Alongside working at IDEO, Sally is a practising conceptual artist and applies her creative approach to devising programmes for organisations that help them to become more innovative and sustain their approach.
Sally has a background of over 20 years in industrial relations, leadership development and organisational design, working mainly on large change programmes in creative organisations (Nickelodeon, Paramount, Penguin Books and the BBC) as well as in the public sector.
Sally holds a Masters Degree in Management Learning from Lancaster University and a Masters of Fine Art from Goldsmiths College, University of London.
