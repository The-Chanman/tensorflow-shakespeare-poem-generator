Mackenzie Luong
Mackenzie is an Organizational Designer with IDEO's Design for Change studio where she helps bring innovative ideas to life.
Prior to joining IDEO, Mackenzie lived in the management consulting world, tackling things like, How might we help a multinational corporation be more nimble to solve their customers biggest issues faster? Or, How might we simplify and humanize the integration experience of newly acquired companies?
Mackenzie loves organization, making hard things simple and guiding people through change to discover their own "ah ha!" moments. When she's not making frameworks or color coding her bookshelf, you might run into her hiking California's wilderness or picnicking in the park with a bottle of wine.
