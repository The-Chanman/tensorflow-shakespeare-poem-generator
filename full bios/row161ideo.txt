Simon King
Simon King is a Design Director at IDEO where he helps organizations launch products and services that make the world more responsive, connected, and humane. Since joining IDEO in 2007 he has led the growth of interaction design across diverse mediums and audiences including medical imaging equipment, vehicle HMI platforms, health tracking apps, and financial planning tools.
Decades of experience designing, building, and maintaining digital products has taught him the value of adaptability, the importance of combining macro and micro thinking, and the lesson that all products must evolve. He’s just as comfortable envisioning the distant future as optimizing a two-week sprint, but always with a human-centered approach.
Simon has a commitment to sharing his design knowledge and experience in both conference and classroom settings. In an era of connected objects, he advocates for hybrid designers that span traditional disciplines in his book Understanding Industrial Design: Principles for UX and Interaction Design, published on O’Reilly.
He holds a BFA in Graphic Design from Western Michigan and an MDes in Interaction Design from Carnegie Mellon.
