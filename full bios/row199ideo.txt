Travis Lee
For over a decade at IDEO, Travis has helped leaders at the helm of Fortune 500 companies to bootstrapped startups build products, services, and ventures that reinvent their organizations and disrupt markets. Fluent at using human-centered design techniques to solve innovation challenges and deliver new opportunities into the world, Travis excels at engagements that exist at the intersection of brand, transformation, technology, and seemingly impossible. Most recently, he's had a front seat consulting Ford's transformation from a car manufacturer to a mobility service provider; helped the leadership team at an historic science and technology museum chart a new course for the storied institution; and enabled a major Japanese medical equipment company and a well-known American food brand to confidently create and launch new, cutting-edge brands.
As Managing Director of IDEO Chicago, Travis' creative leadership focuses on data as a new medium for design and the pursuit of design excellence. He frequently speaks on topics such as prototyping, design methods, and venturing, and guest lectures at Northwestern University's McCormick School of Engineering and Kellogg School of Management.
Before joining IDEO, Travis spent four years at Medtronic in the Cardiac Rhythm Management division where he focused on concept development and test engineering for implantable cardiac-pacing leads, which resulted in a patented lead implantation system.
He holds a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Minnesota and an honorary doctorate in cookie baking from his friends.
