Nicki Sch채fer
As a product designer with IDEO's Munich studio, Nicki is passionate about prototyping and committed to bridging the gap between the analogue and digital worlds. Skillfully combining his understanding of digital interactions with his experience in traditional product design, Nicki helps clients better understand their customers' needs through compelling product and service solutions.
Nicki holds a bachelor's degree in product design from the Hochschule f체r Gestaltung Schw채bisch Gm체nd and a master's degree in industrial design from the Technical University in Munich. During his studies he worked with several different startups in Munich and participated in accelerator programs with the Technical University and Google.
Having begun his academic career in an engineering program, Nicki quickly discovered that he longed for a more human-centric discipline and before going on to study design, he took a break to make furniture at a carpenter shop. He still loves working with his hands, exploring creative solutions, and making ideas tangible with prototypes. In search of cooking the perfect steak, for example, he successfully built his own lo-fi sous vide machine for his family's Christmas dinner.
