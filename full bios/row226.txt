Jill Levinsohn
Jill Levinsohn is a business lead at IDEO. Based in the Bay Area, she focuses on designing client engagements and strategies anchored in brand-relevant consumer experiences that create business growth and impact.
Jill’s passion lies in understanding and enabling the relationships that design seeks to create—whether it’s between a designer and a user, or a company and its consumers. She enjoys seeing them manifest in the reimagination of industries, the solution of knotty problems, and the ability to make people’s lives better or more interesting.
Prior to joining IDEO in 2011, Jill worked as a strategic planner and brand strategist in the advertising and brand world. She has worked across a variety of clients and industries, from consumer air travel to enterprise technology. Regardless of the challenge, she has always delighted in uncovering and defining brands that define a company’s communications, product and service development, and internal culture.
Jill received a BS in Communications from Northwestern University and her MA from the University of Southern California, where she focused on the intersection of global brands and regional specificity. She has a weakness for all things handmade, and can never turn down an invitation to karaoke.
