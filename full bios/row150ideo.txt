As a Senior Design Lead at IDEO Palo Alto, Sebastian delivers projects with a focus on digital services, strategy, and organizational transformation. As a business designer, he is out to find you a clever way to make money with your shiny and new, IDEO-developed offer. With his entrepreneurial attitude and an understanding of market dynamics and positioning, he develops new business models and balances intuition with analytical insight.
Prior to IDEO, Sebastian was a senior consultant with Accenture Management Consulting and a junior project leader with a management consulting startup. He left these positions because he believes that growth is best accomplished through Post-its and design, optimism and experimentation rather than PowerPoint decks created in an ivory tower. He holds an MA in Psychology from the University of Munich and spent time in the MBA program the University of Alberta.
When he’s not working, Sebastian satisfies his curiosity for digital technology or packs his bags to travel – often seeking spots where he can indulge his love of diving wrecks and caves.
