Ross Lockwood
Thoughtful and accomplished, Ross Lockwood is an industrial designer who enjoys embodying user values gleaned from field research into the forms he creates. He aspires to craft tangible experiences that “feel intuitive, enjoyable and seamlessly natural.”
Since joining IDEO in 2008, Ross has brought his minimalist and desirable sensibility to projects ranging from cell phones, water fountains, and pet-care products, to insulin pens, drug-delivery systems, and organ transporters. He counts among his clients AT&T, 3M, Eli Lilly, ConAgra, Target and ORS.
Before IDEO, Ross was a lead designer at Priestmangoode, a London-based design consultancy where he helped take concepts to market on a variety of product, transportation, and environmental projects. Winning awards for such clients as Accor Etap Europe and Kingfisher Airlines. He holds a 1st Class BA honors degree in Industrial Design and an MA in Design Products from the Royal College of Art in London.
Raised on the Island of Guernsey in the English Channel, Ross’ love of travel and quiet solitude have led him on cross-country cycling adventures across France, Great Britain, Nepal, and—as soon as he finds the time—America.
