Heather Boesch
As the Director of Operations for IDEO Cambridge and a leader of IDEO's public sector practice, Heather works at the intersection of business, design and organizational strategy, with a focus on helping local, federal and international governments tackle complex systemic challenges and design innovative citizen-centered services. Her recent work includes advising US Immigration and Customs Services and the City of Boston on modernizing their digital presences, and working with USAID to adapt private-sector demand generation techniques to improve public health outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa.
Prior to joining IDEO, Heather lived in the Middle East while serving as the Director of Operations for a trucking company run by tribal Sheikhs that endeavored to bring economic relief to communities adversely affected by war, and simultaneously co-founded New World Design, a collective of designers working on humanitarian projects in post-war Iraq, including potable water dissemination networks, wheelchair distribution, transportation infrastructure, mobile medical services, and affordable housing constructed from US military refuse. Heather has also worked as a research analyst at McKinsey, as a member of the education team at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, and as part of a core team that designed a specialized air cargo shuttle service using decommissioned US Air Force jets to transform the supply chain logistics of industrial projects in the world's most remote locations.
Heather holds a BA with Honors in Economics from Harvard, where she graduated in the top 2% of her class, an MA in Architecture from the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and has completed Executive Education at Harvard Business School in Private Equity and Venture Finance. Outside IDEO, Heather is an advisor at Eastern Foundry, an incubator convening startups, government agencies and contractors to drive innovation in government and currently serves as an appointee on the National Advisory Council on Innovation and Entrepreneurship for the Department of Commerce.
