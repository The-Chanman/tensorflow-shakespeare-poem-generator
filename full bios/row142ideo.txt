Sarah Codraro
As marketing lead for IDEO San Francisco, Sarah Codraro helps to amplify the impact and activity of IDEO around the world, creating flexible systems to support consistent brand strength and evolution. By digging below the surface and understanding what motivates others, she is best able to tell the stories that build a brand and give it life.
With a bachelor's degree from Bates College in both international relations and visual arts, Sarah utilizes her unique left brain / right brain sensibility to channel both the concrete and intangible in order to build the strongest stories and stickiest brands. Prior to joining IDEO, Sarah helped companies and agencies create crystal-clear expressions of themselves and share those expressions around the world to drive business.
In her free time Sarah keeps busy, working to empower other young women in their careers, exploring the nooks and crannies of the California coast and eating her way across Oakland.
