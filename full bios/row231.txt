John Feole
John is the Front Desk Concierge at IDEO Cambridge.  A jack of all trades around the office, he finds the most joy at work when infusing moments of happiness in people's busy days.  As a member of the experience team, he acts as support for the design community and helps to orchestrate world-class experiences for clients and IDEOers.
After graduating with honors from Virginia Commonwealth University, John spent his twenties traveling around the world and working any job that supported his dream of becoming a writer (butcher, truck driver and concierge, to name a few).  His short fiction has been published three times and won VCU's undergraduate fiction contest three years in a row.
Before IDEO, John also helped launch an art and culture magazine in Richmond, VA and cofounded FUNC, a furniture company that sells tables with interchangeable tops illustrated by local artists (think Netflix for tabletops).
On his days off you can find John losing to the chess hustlers in Harvard Square, hitting up jazz clubs or exploring random parts of the city on his moped.
