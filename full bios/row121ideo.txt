Rich Cahill
Rich Cahill is an interaction designer at IDEO London, designing and prototyping human centric shapes for emerging technologies.
In 2016, Rich graduated from DJCAD, University of Dundee with a 1st class Honours in Digital Interaction Design. His final year project, yougra.ph focused on designing mental health support tools with AI technologies, earned him the Sir James Black award for most outstanding contribution to research and scholarship in his field.
When not knee deep in design process or prototype code, Rich spends as much time as possible climbing walls as an avid boulderer, sailing oceans as a qualified yacht skipper and creating generative print magazines as a post-digital publishing enthusiast.
