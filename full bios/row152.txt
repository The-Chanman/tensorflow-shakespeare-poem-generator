Ethan Klein
Ethan is a Web Developer in the IDEO Digital Shop. He enjoys working across the technology stack though spends most of his time on the front end. Javascript patterns, digital audio manipulation, weather-visualizations and the future of the web are a few things he's jazzed about. Before coming to IDEO Ethan worked as a developer at Rhapsody music, Surfline, and the Sierra Club.
Ethan holds a BA in Philosophy from the University of Pennsylvania. When not on the computer he can be found surfing, improvising on the guitar or trying to keep up with his sons.
