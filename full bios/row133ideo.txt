Sally Sosa
Sally is IDEO’s Director of Talent focused on Culture and Communications. She partners closely with IDEO’s Recruiting, Learning & Development, and HR teams to shape the IDEO employee experience, leading the design and implementation of internal channels, tools, and platforms that keep the community connected to IDEO’s culture and values.
Prior to IDEO, Sally was in the music business in Austin, TX. After graduating from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Management Information Systems, she started a music management company where she channeled her tenacious problem solving and empathy for the creative spirit to nurture the careers of emerging bands. She also spent several years booking and promoting large-scale events with Clear Channel, SXSW, and Austin City Limits Music Festival. After an existential crisis and the epiphany that she belonged in the audience rather than “with the band”, she headed west for California and landed at IDEO, trading high-maintenance musicians for even higher-maintenance designers.
Her former life has served her well, as she now enables IDEO’s creative talent to do the best work of their lives. She designed and implemented a program to help project teams get unstuck and build alignment, produces IDEO’s employee handbook, The Big Book of IDEO, and was the drumbeat behind The Weekly WOW, a weekly recap of culture and project stories that connect and inspire the community across 10 global studios.
As an introverted people-person, she is equally as happy curating a playlist to set the dance floor on fire as she is exploring the Bay Area landscape in solitude. Inspired by the overlaps of mind, body, and environment, she received her Yoga teaching certification in 2005 and moonlights as an interior designer. She is currently chasing fleeting moments of stillness while raising a toddler.
