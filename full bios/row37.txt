Anne Trausch
Whether the medium is film, photography or writing—Anne Trausch believes in the power of a well-told story. Anne is a writer and brand strategist who comes to IDEO with nearly ten years of experience working for top-drawer advertising agencies from Amsterdam to San Francisco (and New York, Phoenix and Minneapolis in between). Past clients include Whole Foods Market, Weetabix North America, UCSF Medical Center, Ziba Beauty, Puffins Cereal, KnightRidder Media, Taco Bell and more. She’s especially interested in using narrative in designing branded experiences and services.
Despite her urban adulthood, Anne grew up on a grain farm in rural Nebraska just one mile from a “town” of twelve and most notably a soda machine (Pepsi). In her spare time she’s a rock climber, a filmmaker, a photographer, and a bold traveler. Ask her about her first trip out of America—to Uganda.
Anne holds a Bachelor of Journalism in Advertising from the University of Nebraska Lincoln, completed coursework at the Miami Ad School Minneapolis and has taught graduate and undergraduate classes at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco.
