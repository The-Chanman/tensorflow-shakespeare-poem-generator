Madeline Armstrong
Before joining the IDEO U team as the Studio Coordinator, Madeline taught and mentored students both in the SF Bay Area and abroad, gaining a wide array of international education experience. She is focused on people, and loves creating communities that collaborate and unify over shared experiences. She'll also take the chance any day to travel, dance, make lists, and ask curious questions.
