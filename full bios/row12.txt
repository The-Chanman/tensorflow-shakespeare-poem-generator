Alex Staudt
Alex Staudt is a digital alchemist. He excels at technical problem solving, coding and prototyping. Imagine something crazy, and Alex can probably make it.
He transitioned to IDEO from the respected Design & Technology program at Parsons School of Design, NYC. He also holds an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Calgary, Canada.
Over the last few years he has worked on a diverse mix of successful projects (fuzzywobble.com), most related to DIY technology, product design, interactive installation, and viral web content.
At an early age he worked along side structural engineers, designing bridges in Calgary, Canada. He also worked for Alstom Engineering on large scale gas turbines in Zurich, Switzerland.
Alex appreciates when technology and design converge towards a creative outcome, preferably something that others can interact with and enjoy.
