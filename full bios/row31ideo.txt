Maggie Howekamp
Maggie Howekamp oversees the portfolio of work for the Design for Change Studio in IDEO's San Francisco Office. Design for Change uses IDEO's human centered approach to design culture, inspire collaboration and foster innovation. Maggie works with clients to create meaningful change in their organization by partnering with them to build projects and programs that not only help companies produce better products and outcomes, but to also consistently behave in new ways to have a lasting effect.
Before focusing on building relationships for Design for Change at IDEO, Maggie spent several years working on project teams doing design research to uncover latent needs and inspiration for technology, CPG, education and service organizations. She left IDEO to attend Stanford University to get her MBA. While at Stanford, Maggie fell in love with understanding the importance of culture at organizations and understanding the behavioral studies that drive current organizational theory.
Prior to returning to IDEO, Maggie worked in business development for a Colorado based company that specializes in creating web platforms and data visualizations for financial services and media companies. Maggie is proud of her mostly unused BA in Art History from the University of California at Berkeley. Maggie is a lover of design in all its incarnations, from interior design to modern art to architecture. When not obsessing over design, you can find Maggie skiing in the Sierras or fly-fishing in the Rockies.
