Meredith Adams-Smart
Meredith has a deep sense of curiosity about people and their stories. As a writer by training she looks to understand the beliefs, choices, and challenges that people convey when sharing their experiences and how those narratives can move design toward tangible solutions. Before joining IDEO Chicago, Meredith was as a writer and project manager for a Chicago design firm focused on nonprofit organizations and higher ed. Working with organizations that serve some of the most disenfranchised segments of the population it was important to understand how shifting services to a technological platform would impact access for users. Interviews with administration, staff, and users shaped the content and design of projects ranging from supportive house, to sustainable energy and environmental challenges in order to ensure that stakeholders at every level were a part of the process.
After years of working within nonprofit organizations, specifically early childhood education and food advocacy, Meredith saw the fundamental need for design on a holistic level in order for organizations to effectively shape and grow their impact.
After graduating with a degree in English from Kalamazoo College, Meredith moved abroad to work for the French Ministry of Education in the north of France teaching junior high, which was the most challenging job that she has had to date.
Meredith tends to a rooftop garden in the summer, a list of documentaries in the winter, and an unreasonable amount of books year-round. She is a certified Hatha yoga teacher and a compulsive traveler, most recently to Peru which she will happily gush about.
