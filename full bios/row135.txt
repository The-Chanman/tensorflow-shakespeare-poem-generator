Diem Ho
Diem Ho is a prototyping specialist at IDEO. He is based in Palo Alto and travels around the world whenever his expertise is called for.
As a prototyping specialist, Diem builds physical models to express ideas, seek learnings and provoke further thoughts. He has built a range of prototypes from handheld devices, refrigerators, car interiors, to 14,000 sq. ft. spaces. Once the objectives and needs for prototyping are identified, Diem is one of a handful of experts at IDEO who can immediately gauge the best and the right way to execute.
A good prototype is one that answers a question at minimal cost, time and energy, and one that can be modified at speed. Diem believes that prototyping is the quickest way to make others understand oneâ€™s thoughts without misinterpretation. It is the difference between reading a book and watching a movie where the latter shows you exactly what the story works like, feels like and look like. Importantly, prototyping in business means reducing risks and costs.
Diem has been building prototypes for over 14 years. Prior to joining IDEO, he ran his own independent business building prototypes for major design studios in the Bay Area, including Lunar Design and Fuse Projects.
Diem holds a BSc Industrial Design from San Jose State University and has also studied industrial design in Germany. In his spare time, he likes to travel to lesser-explored places, make his own art, sculptures and all things tactile.
