Grace Nicklin
Grace is a Senior Design Lead at IDEO Cambridge where she spends her time getting to know, and building empathy for, people. As a Design Researcher, Grace has sat on living room couches (and futons, and mats, and floors) across the globe to get to know people, and to build an understanding for what it is they need and desire. As a design and project lead Grace collaborates closely with clients and IDEO teams to create design solutions that are deeply human, refreshingly unique, and have a long life ahead of them.
Grace has worked with clients across a breadth of industries, from music to healthcare and everything in between. Of her work at IDEO, Grace is particularly proud of working with a Fortune 500 company to conceive of, pilot, and launch an entirely new venture far from their core business, that caters to people living paycheck to paycheck and does both well and good. Other favorite projects include rethinking the meaning of retirement for Boomers, and rallying our 60 person studio to create a massive art installation consisting of 20,000 unique dowels. Â 
Prior to IDEO, Grace worked at DaVita Inc, where she helped pilot new initiatives based on conversations she had with patients and nurses on the dialysis room floor. Years spent chatting with countless people while waiting tables, however, prepared Grace to design for humans in a way no desk job could have. Grace holds a BA in Political Studies and Writing from the Claremont Colleges.
