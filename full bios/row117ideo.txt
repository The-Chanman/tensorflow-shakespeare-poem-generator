Remy Jauffret
Remy is a Communication Design Lead at IDEO, Shanghai. He is skilled at using storytelling to add context and texture to business strategy and brings it to life compellingly through visual communication. He applies this to his work in creating and repositioning brands, designing experiences and unlocking an organisation's value through its people. He has worked across a range of industries, including retail, food and beverage, consumer goods and education. Some of his clients at IDEO are Shinho Foods, Wall Street English, Fotile Kitchen Ware, Hunter Gatherer in China, John Deere in India, and Intercorp in Peru.
Before joining IDEO, Remy spent several years working in London on branding and corporate communications for clients such as SABMiller and Brunswick Group. In 2011, he moved from the UK to Vietnam to work as Creative Director for The Purpose Group in Ho Chi Minh City. Remy's work in Vietnam was focused on delivering positive and quantifiable impact in health, nutrition and education. His clients at the time included Bayer, Danone, Abbott, Unilever and Samsung.
Remy grew up in South Africa and studied in France and the UK. He holds a degree in Visual Communication from Olivier de Serres in Paris and a Masters degree in Creative Practice for Narrative Environments from Central St. Martins School of Art and Design, London.
Having lived in different places in the world and worked in both developed and developing economies, Remy looks at design as a man on the ground, aiming to understand the heartbeat of people and cultures, seeking out insights anywhere from boardrooms to street kitchens. In his spare time he slowly but surely soldiers his way through Penguin Modern Classics, or Remy can be found aggressively growing plants and vegetables with his family on whatever patch of ground available. His guilty pleasure is English football. Remy speaks fluent English, French, and is learning Chinese.
