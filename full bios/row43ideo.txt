Matt Avallone
Matt Avallone is an Environments Designer within IDEO's San Francisco office. A recent graduate of Pennsylvania State Universities' Architecture program with a minor in Sustainable Strategies. Working in architecture firms across the US and the South Pacific, Matt is hoping to use architecture to solve some of the many questions facing our cities in the near future.
To begin to solve some of these issues, he did his thesis on the potentials of 3d printing within architecture and the effects of embracing capitalism on the struggling industry. Focusing on the technology as an answer to the question of architecture for the masses, as well as solving the issues of population growth and responding to the potential of smart cities. To exemplify these ideas he designed an extension to the Bauhaus Archive in Berlin and a residential tower on Roosevelt Island in NYC using the technology.
Excited about exploring outside of his field, Matt has worked independently on architectural graffiti with NY based illustrators, designed logos and merchandise for touring musicians and a new shopping experience for boutique store owners. He also runs his own clothing company to learn more about the intricacies of running a business and maintaining inventory.
