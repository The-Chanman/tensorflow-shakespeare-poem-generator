Matt Weiss
Matt Weiss is Managing Director at IDEO CoLab, a shared R&D network that explores how emerging technology will reshape society's systems. As a technologist turned designer, Matt loves combining those worlds to take on system-level design challenges like how blockchains will affect our health system or how the Internet of Things will affect our food system.
Prior to co-founding the CoLab, Matt spent several years in IDEO's consulting business working across industries. Matt spent much of his early career in or around financial servicesâ€”an industry into which he is deeply passionate about infusing human centeredness. He helped to launch the peer-to-peer lending movement in the U.S. at CircleLending and led several efforts at Fidelity to make the online experience more useful. Matt also co-founded Boston Logic, an ongoing real estate software firm.
Matt holds an MBA from MIT's Sloan School of Management and a BS in Computer Science and Economics from Tufts University. Outside of the office, you'll find Matt on his bike, behind a camera, trying local beers or brewing his own.
