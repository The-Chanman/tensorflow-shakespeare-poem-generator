Rob Rehrig
Hardware hacker by day, design deliriant by night; Rob Rehrig is an electrical engineer at IDEO with a passion for human-computer interaction, music, and rapid prototyping. As a member of the IDEO Chicago studio, Rob uses his powers to build functional models of wild ideas that float through the office using both hardware and software.
Rob holds both a BEE and MS in electrical engineering from University of Delaware, as well as a MS in Music Engineering Technology from University of Miami (Florida). Rob is an avid runner, and his bicycle is his main mode of transportation year-round. In his spare time, he also enjoys creating gnarly rotoscopes and illustrations, playing video games, and exploring new projects that brew his head.
