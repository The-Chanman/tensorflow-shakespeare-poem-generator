Shoshana Berger
A writer and editor, Shoshana crafts IDEO’s editorial voice and creative direction. Our team is multidisciplinary and everyone here has a point of view, so her challenge is to tell a cohesive story about IDEO’s work in the world while still turning up the volume on individual voices.
Before joining IDEO, Shoshana worked in various editorial posts with: WIRED (for whom she conceived and launched a new web vertical, Wired Design) Amazon, The New York Times, Travel + Leisure, Sunset, Budget Travel, Ritz Carlton Magazine, Business 2.0, Popular Science, SPIN, the San Francisco Chronicle, the San Francisco Weekly, Salon, Raygun, and RollingStone.com.
 The cofounder and editor in chief of ReadyMade magazine, Shoshana helped lead a national publication from zero to 350,000 circulation, launching ReadyMade’s website, books, branded products, and events. ReadyMade was a finalist for National Magazine Awards in General Excellence in 2005 and 2006 and was acquired by the Meredith Corp. in 2006.
As an editorial director at Young & Rubicam, she delivered insights on the youth market for Sony electronics, United, Mattel, and Ford Motor Co.
  Publications include: Unscrolled (Workman, 2013); ReadyMade: How to Make Almost Everything (Crown, 2005); and Worldchanging: A User’s Guide for the 21st Century (by Alex Steffen, Al Gore, and Bruce Sterling)
