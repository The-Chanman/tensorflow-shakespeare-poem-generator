Benjamin Forman
Ben Forman, a Project Lead and Industrial Designer at IDEO London, works on a broad array of consumer experience projects — communications, product, packaging design — and delights in figuring out ways to make the intangible tangible.
Since joining IDEO in 2007, Ben has helped a large charitable organization transform from a product-orientated retailer into a holistic service provider; supported a baby-bottle manufacturer with its packaging and a communication strategy; and assisted a well-known footwear company in bringing a compelling cultural and emotional story to its new designs and brand extension.
Ben holds a bachelor’s degree in product design from Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, London. In his free time, he enjoys building and restoring everything, from bikes to boats. This hands-on tinkering frequently extends to his work, where he uses tangible prototyping in order to solve problems.
