Andrew Evans
Andrew Evans is a Product Designer at IDEO, although his passion for creating engaging, meaningful, and visceral experiences often finds him designing beyond the realm of physical products. He loves working across a range of disciplines to bring creativity and delight into the lives of others.
Andrew attended the Joint Program in Design at Stanford University where he was ecstatic to find a community of people who also believe that Art and Engineering can be complimentary disciplines guided by human values. After graduating, he became a Visiting Lecturer at Stanford where he has taught classes at the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) and in the Performing Arts Department.
Andrew’s design influences are eclectic, to say the least. Originally from Seattle, WA, Andrew returned home to design and build high-end treehouses at Nelson Treehouse and Supply. He also spent many years in Rhode Island and New York creating theatrical sets and environments, and recently led the creation of a immersive theatrical experience performed on Alcatraz Island.
Andrew has been a professional magician since the age of 12, and he is constantly exploring the intersection of Magic and Design—two disciplines attempting to create a world unbound by the word impossible. He continues to pursue this exploration at IDEO where his goal is always to inject projects with a little Wonder.
