Lynn Winter
Lynn brings her years of IDEO adventures to the Global Technology group as the team's User Experience Director. With a deep understanding and curiosity as to how knowledge travels throughout our organization, she evangelizes new uses for technology in service of improving experiences and cultivating valuable content.
Winter started her IDEO journey in Palo Alto with the Global Marcom team managing our published works and leading initiatives to streamline common workflows. Involved in early knowledge sharing efforts, she directed the first program to build and globally scale a content management system to host IDEO projects, profiles and cultural assets. Based now in Cambridge, Lynn continues to work on a variety of projects with distributed teams, optimizing systems that support the business.
Prior to IDEO, Lynn navigated New York's media market working in radio and television production before settling at Sony Music Studios to establish their video operations group. She holds a BA in Communication Studies from the State University of New York, and yearns to find balance between the fine art of parenting and creative multitasking.
