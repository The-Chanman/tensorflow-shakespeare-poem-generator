Shunsuke Ishikawa
Shun is a Design Director at IDEO Tokyo. In addition to helping lead and guide teams to tackle complex challenges for our clients, he also plays an important role in bridging the larger design, business, and education communities in Japan. Currently Shun is especially interested in the intersection of products and services -- constantly thinking about how to introduce more “kindness” into the things we use everyday, especially technology. Prior to joining, Shun worked at Panasonic as well as PDD, a leading British design and innovation consultancy, where he worked on a broad range of projects from consumer electronics, automotive, medical, packaging to service design.
Shun holds a BA degree from Central Saint Martins College of Arts & Design in the UK.
