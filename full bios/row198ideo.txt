Tracey Milne
Tracey is a design lead at IDEO Cambridge with a focus in brand strategy and writing. While she is adept in making words pretty, her true value is in pushing teams to create compelling and differentiated offerings that tug at the heart strings and move people to action. She perseveres to blend business with poetry to bring a sense of beauty and meaning to the world and the people we design for.
Of her work at IDEO, she is most proud of creating a provocative brand that empowers women in South Africa to protect themselves from HIV, as well as launching an insurance product that had snowboarders and skiers "oohing" and "aahing" over insurance. Insurance!
She hails from South Africa originally where she was an award-winning senior copywriter and strategic planner with a diverse portfolio of both local and international client work, including through-the-line and experiential advertising.
And in her spare time? Armed with a rampant curiosity, she is always in pursuit of a more interesting story: volunteering as a regional committee member of Mensa South Africa, painting murals for businesses and campaigns, designing and selling lazer-engraved jewellery, playing djembe by rivers, attending shamanic journeys in old churches, sneaking into abandoned buildings to wrap jump, and sleeping in the dirty beds of an overnight train in India as well as between the clean sheets of the Queen's apartment in the Horses' Guard are just the beginning.
