Rhonda LeRocque
Rhonda is an experience specialist in our Cambridge studio where she joined the IDEO team over a decade ago. She's passionate about the IDEO culture and community, as well as the health and wellness of the studio. She takes these things into consideration when orchestrating wholesome meals and snacks for our clients and colleagues. She also works closely with project teams to assist in highlighting various project touchpoints by creating and weaving unique and unexpected experiences throughout the life of a project. She also assists her experience team in crafting community activities and curating events that help fuel inspiration and invigorate our design community and clients. Â 
Prior to working at IDEO Rhonda managed her own cleaning and organizational business. She now leverages those skills to assist in maintaining order amidst a creative studio. In her spare time you'll likely find Rhonda at home in her kitchen whipping up a few new recipes to share with her colleagues, friends and family. She often finds her inspiration when traveling with her husband and daughter, especially on their yearly trip to Hawaii!
