Joshua Lavra
At IDEO, Josh leads business development and marketing for IDEO's Design for Change Products team. These products –– Creative Difference, IDEO U, and OI Engine –– have been developed to help engage more leaders and individuals in creative, innovative, and purpose-driven change.
With a background in chemical engineering, Josh has led projects in business, design, technology, and communications. In his most recent venture prior to joining IDEO, Josh led the development of a new-to-market consumer product from concept to launch for a large, international organization. This experiment in intrapreneurship is a topic which Josh has given several talks, including one at TEDx in 2016.
Outside of work, Josh is actively involved with the Engineering Ambassadors Network –– a network of engineering students focused on STEM outreach and education. He's also a firm believer that life is better when you're doing and spends his spare time painting, writing, cycling, and making. Over the last two years, Josh has participated in AIDS/LifeCycle –– a 545 mile bike ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles in support of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation and Los Angeles LGBT Center.
