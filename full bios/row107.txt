Daniel De Runtz
Danny DeRuntz is a Design Director at IDEO Cambridge, where he explores how emerging technology and culture should intersect. An IDEO veteran for over 20 years, he has always been at the forefront of new design disciplines - leading the charge  as IDEO explores the new frontiers made possible though tech. 
His focus on technology is grounded in a deep understanding of social dynamics and the factors that drive humans to interact with each other (and emerging technologies) in intriguing ways. He is known for pushing teams to explore the fringes of possibilities both technically and conceptually - always striving to find the bigger idea. 
His work is defined by how it confidently challenges existing systems and completely reshapes them for the better - from designing a new digital immigration experience for the US Government, exploring how emerging technologies like blockchains can bring transparency into the food system, to creating iconic interactions for companies in home security, financial services, home goods, health, creativity software, and education platforms.
The king of conceptual metaphors, Danny's ability to capture the essence of a concept or project challenge and evocatively bring it to life is unmatched. With a background in software engineering, motion graphics, and physical prototyping, he's in his element when bringing tangibility to the abstract - moving from theory to action to make the possible (and sometimes impossible) feel compelling and real. He makes the future un-seeable.
