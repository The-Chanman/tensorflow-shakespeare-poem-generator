Shayna Proctor
Shayna Proctor strives to facilitate better communication between cultures and communities through thoughtful design. As an interaction designer at IDEO she creates solutions to big design challenges, keeping in mind the "little people" and the "big people" that could be effected. Shayna hopes to make design more inclusive by creating space for more people to have a voice and be a part of the process.
Shayna says “yes” to being involved in a variety of projects from a phone application that helps schizophrenic patients set goals to rethinking a state’s public education system. She loves thinking through and designing for the interactions of people with products and services.
Prior to working at IDEO Shayna has had the privilege of working in many different places with many diverse clients. She feels comfortable initiating and participating in difficult conversations about social justice, classism, racism and how each person's decisions effect a bigger community. She holds a bachelor's degree in graphic design from Brigham Young University and a master’s in Interaction design from California College of the Arts. She loves people, places and cheese.
