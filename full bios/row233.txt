John Ravitch
John Ravitch is a Partner in IDEO San Francisco's Design for Change studio, where he helps organizations reach their creative potential. An architect by training, John focuses on building empathic, innovative client cultures through design thinking. John's recent work includes helping a major bank identify its corporate purpose; designing the future of the car buying experience; rethinking how law firms can be more client-focused; helping a leading media brand effectively scale its offer; building client-centric learning labs for a top global consultancy; and launching consumer service experiences in retail. Since joining IDEO in 2002, John has deepened his brand experience through his work with clients as diverse as Netflix, Ford, Deloitte, Comcast, and Diageo. When he's not deeply embedded in design projects, John works closely with design teams to inspire their work and leads IDEO's Alumni strategy.
Prior to IDEO, John cut his teeth at CKS Partners, the top digital brand agency in Silicon Valley which was retained by Steve Jobs to rethink Apple's marketing effort upon his return to the company in the late 1990s. John learned a great deal about Steve's “reality distortion field” in first person while strategizing core marketing efforts for the early, colorful iMacs.
He began his design career as a practicing architect for several global design firms, most notably for Skidmore and Owings & Merrill. John attended Tufts University and received a Master of Architecture from the University of Pennsylvania. In his free time, he searches for steep hills as a globally ranked competitive slalom skateboarder.
