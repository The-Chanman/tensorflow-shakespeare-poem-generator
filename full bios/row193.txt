HJ Kwon
HJ is a Design Researcher at IDEO NYC who's deeply curious about understanding the lives and perspectives of others. He's inspired by the opportunity to help both teammates and clients empathize with the needs, desires, and behaviors of the people at the receiving end of our designs. He believes that design research can inform every phase of the design process starting with understanding the problem using open-ended research and validating solutions with metrics and analytics. Since joining IDEO, HJ has worked on various projects related to health care and life sciences, including helping a client in the diabetes space reinvent it's future offering to type 2 diabetes patients so that they can achieve better health outcomes.
Prior to joining IDEO he worked on teams creating digital products, first in a product studio within Droga5 called DE-DE and later at Made By Many. He's collaborated with major international clients such as the NFL, Colgate, and Finnair while also helping smaller startups like Justworks and Cava Grill rapidly bring digital products to market.
HJ has facilitated design thinking workshops at Wharton Innovation and Design at UPenn and is currently an assistant instructor of UX Research at Pratt Institute.
While he originally went to school at Syracuse University to study journalism, he hopes to translate those skills to design products and services for people. The question he gets asked most often is 'what does your name stand for?'. It stands for Hyuk Joo.
