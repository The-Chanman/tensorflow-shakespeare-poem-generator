After an 8-year stint in advertising working in account management at Batey, Y&R, and BBH on a portfolio of businesses including Citibank, Sony, Unilever, and Singapore Tourism Board, Mike decided to put his greatest skill; talent management, in a different setting. He joined WPP as the group's Talent Director in Singapore. At WPP, his role was to recruit senior executives across the group's different businesses and functions.
Outside of the office, Mike extends his passion for talent to music management with a stable of independent musicians in Singapore.
