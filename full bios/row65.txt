Biz Wells
Biz is a former arts administrator, actor, and housekeeper who is thrilled to make IDEO her new home.
Before joining the IDEO team as Chicago's Leadership Coordinator, she was the Associate Producer for About Face Theatre, one of the nation's oldest and largest LGBTQIA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and allied) professional theatres.  At About Face, Biz was a Jill of all trades and did everything from creating budgets to running production meetings to taking apart the set at the end of a run - basically all the boring (but necessary!) behind-the-scenes roles at a theatre.  Before working as a producer, she worked at About Face and Grant Park Music Festival in development and grant writing.
She's acted at Actors Theatre of Louisville in Kentucky, studied film in India, started her own cleaning company in Philadelphia, and enjoys cooking, biking, and British mini-series. Also Star Trek. She lives in Chicago with her wife Jessica and cat Steve.
