Allison Press
Allison Press is a part of IDEO's Design for Learning team, where she works as an interaction designer to build digital tools that facilitate more engaging learning experiences for students of all ages. She is passionate about translating educational content into relatable experiences for audiences be it in physical or digital space, and is particularly interested in driving progress across the public sector.
Born and raised in Chapel Hill, Allison grew up with a love for community theater, the liberal arts, and college basketball. These interests led her first to UNC Chapel Hill's School of Journalism, then on to a degree in Graphic Design from North Carolina State University. During her time as a college student she worked in the Smithsonian Institution studying how to design educationally diverse and enriching exhibits for museum-goers, and with her university to build a digital curriculum that cultivates students' higher order skills in critical and creative thinking.
In Allison's spare time she returns to her love for the arts, by visiting new museums, dancing in amateur troupes, and dabbling in collage, and also cares deeply about issues related to civic health, social justice, and equity in design and tech.
