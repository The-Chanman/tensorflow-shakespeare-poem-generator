Katrin Klausecker
Katrin is IDEO’s marketing director in Europe. Based in Germany, Katrin leads IDEO’s communication efforts in the region, working in close collaboration with both the UK and German leadership teams. She is passionate about spreading the word of IDEO, seeking to present a cohesive vision, while also placing great emphasis on amplifying individual IDEO voices.
Since joining IDEO in 2009, Katrin has helped shape IDEO’s position as a thought-leader in innovation and design in Europe. Katrin is always on the lookout for opportunities for her team to tell the impact story of IDEO’s work in the world, through traditional and new media outlets, as well as public conferences.
Before joining IDEO, Katrin served in marketing leadership roles with The Economist Group in Europe, the US and Asia. Relishing the opportunity the position gave her to work with world-class editors, business people and government, she was also integral in bringing them together to participate in the renowned Economist Conferences. Prior to this, Katrin worked for the European Center for Modern Languages at the Council of Europe in Graz, Austria. She studied at Karl Franzens Universität Graz, Austria, the Université Catholique de l’Ouest, Angers, France, and the Université de Strasbourg. She holds a master’s in translation studies.
Whilst living and working in Asia she caught the travel bug and is not likely to sit still for too long. When she does manage to stick around Munich, she can be found up in the mountains, or out on the lake sailing.
