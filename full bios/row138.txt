Dogan Sekercioglu
Dogan Sekercioglu is a Senior Industrial Designer at IDEO Chicago, who combines craft and passion to understand and design solutions for complex, systemic challenges. Having worked in Turkey, Denmark, Sweden, Kenya, and the United States, his varied experience spans from industrial machinery, retail interiors, and exhibition design, to production design, food design, and consumer electronics.
Originally from Istanbul, Turkey, Dogan started making and breaking as a young boy in his father's model making workshop. His fondest memory is the time he successfully flew and landed a rubber-powered balsa plane that he modified, against his father's will. He ran a victory lap in a poppy field, as one does. He was seven. He earned a Bachelor's in Industrial Design in Istanbul, studied photography and strategic design in Norway, and then earned his MFA in Advanced Product Design from the Ume√• Institute of Design.
He first landed in IDEO's Cambridge studio as an intern, where he worked on packaging innovation, sustainable energy storage, and conceptual video production. He left with two patents, and eventually settled in at IDEO Chicago a few years later. Over the years, he has worked with clients such as World Bank, Ford, GE, ConAgra, Atlas Copco, Timberland, Jordan, and Cisco.
Dogan's work has been recognized internationally by design awards such as Red Dot, IDEA, IF, and Core77. When he's not engaging with clients or building something in the shop, he can be found daydreaming about his future space trip, first sailboat, or next hiking adventure.
