David Aycan
David Aycan is an entrepreneur and business designer. He leads the development of new ventures for IDEO's Design for Change studio. David is currently focused on helping leaders to build more creatively competitive organizations—companies capable of leading through innovation, adapting quickly to market changes, and effectively improving their operations. 
David is a mechanical engineer and an MBA by training. After several years designing mechanical equipment for pharmaceutical facilities, he decided to start his first business in Toronto—a skateboard company that he expanded to the United States and Japan. Driven to entrepreneurship for creative reasons, David quickly fell in love with the art of business, and decided to get an MBA while simultaneously launching a design-forward apparel company. 
Thanks to perfect timing, David became a founding member of IDEO's business design discipline in 2008, which he led and grew from an emerging discipline of nine designers to a global powerhouse representing about 10 percent of IDEO's designers. Over a nine-year span, David has led dozens of product development, and venture design programs in web-services, consumer electronics, financial services, media and more.
Previously, David was a product manager and product marketing lead at Square, and VP of Content at Masterclass, an early-stage education startup where he led the design and production of interactive courses, including a tennis course by Serena Williams. He has been interviewed by Forbes on ways that corporations can learn from startups, was featured by BusinessWeek as one of '21 People Who Will Change Business', and wrote 'How Business People Can Become Business Designers' for Rotman Magazine. David has lectured on design process, venturing, and business model design at Stanford, Fuqua, Rotman, Wharton, and various Silicon Valley incubators.
