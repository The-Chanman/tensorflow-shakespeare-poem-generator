Margaret Kessler
Though Margaret Kessler studied fine art formally, she's found a home in creative operations at IDEO, merging her passion for numbers and data within an environment that continually inspires. As executive director of operations, she actively seeks to create the conditions for studios to thrive and new businesses to emerge, helps foster cultural vibrancy, and supports experimentation. Margaret's projects are internally focused and include overseeing the the day-to-day needs of the company and its community in San Francisco and supporting emerging business models as they grow.
One of Margaret's most rewarding experiences at IDEO has been as part of a team focused on redesigning and leading the San Francisco location, honing her skills and fluency at creating an environment for culture and business to prosper. She gravitates toward big-picture challenges, from how to drive new behaviors in bespoke environments to reimagining the customer experience from an operational perspective.
Before joining IDEO in 2008, Margaret helped launch the design group Ammunition and was a project manager at Pentagram Design. Margaret has remained an active artist, exploring mediums such as drawing, sculpture, photography and book arts.
