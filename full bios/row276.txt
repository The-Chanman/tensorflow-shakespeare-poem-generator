Kerry O'Connor
Kerry O’Connor is a Design Director and Business Designer. She works in IDEO’s San Francisco and Tokyo offices. As a leader in the Business Design discipline, Kerry develops new and sustainable ways to monetize innovations. She uses in-market prototyping, hybrid qualitative and quantitative research, and other emerging design approaches to make business strategy tangible and testable.
Kerry brings to IDEO over 15 years’ experience in strategy, brand and product marketing, and finance in service of clients across the US, Asia and Europe. Her training in linguistics and anthropology gives her a unique understanding of people and the cultural context in which they live. She has designed new business ventures, brands, products and workplaces for clients including: Visa in the US, GS Shop and Samsung in South Korea, and Novartis in Switzerland.
Passionate about designing for women, Kerry co-founded Materna Medical, a medical device start-up focused on maternal health. The company’s device aims to prevent immediate physical trauma during childbirth and has been in development since 2007. It is currently in an FDA (Food and Drug Administration) trial.
Prior to joining IDEO, Kerry was a Design Fellow at the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford, known as the d.school. She holds a B.A. in Anthropology, with Honors, from Boston University and an MBA from Stanford University. She continues to be involved with the d.school through lecturing, coaching and mentoring students.
Outside of work, Kerry can be found wandering paths, near and far, where she can get lost and stumble upon sights and scenes that confuse - and ultimately delight - her.
