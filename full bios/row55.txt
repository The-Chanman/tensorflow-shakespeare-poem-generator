A problem solver by nature, she is passionate about meeting complex challenges head-on, and is constantly in search of those solutions that will ultimately improve lives. Particularly adept at understanding the larger picture, while maintaining a keen eye for detail, Barbara approaches her work as an advocate for the intended users, never losing sight of their needs, behaviors, habits and ambitions.

A dedicated traveler, Barbara avails herself of every opportunity to see the world. Next on the list are crossing Iceland by foot, cycling through Cambodia, and kayaking Finland from south to north. When not out seeking adventure she is likely at home baking for friends, or indulging in her new-found affinity for whiskey.
