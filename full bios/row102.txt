Courtney Song
Courtney's fascination with the intersection of global cultures, art, luxury brands, business, and film have taken her across the world. As a Senior Environments Designer at IDEO, she pairs her architecture training with a passion for strategy, design, business, and empathy to build beautiful, viable projects from start to success.
Prior to joining IDEO, Courtney practiced as an architect and researcher in the Netherlands under Rem Koolhaas at the architecture firm OMA and its counterpart AMO, a research studio and think tank. While living in the Netherlands, Courtney designed impactful exhibits, art galleries, and shows for Prada, Miu Miu, and Galeries Lafayette.
In the past, Courtney taught as a Design Studio Instructor and Lecturer at the Cornell Bachelor of Architecture program. During this time, she hunted down stories as a journalist for the Cornell Daily Sun, worked as an architect at Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and shaped a documentary about Cuba's National Art Schools during Fidel Castro's revolution. It premiered globally at the Los Angeles Film Festival.
Courtney holds a Bachelor of Architecture and a Minor in Theory of Architecture with honors from Cornell University. She is constantly searching for a new way to see the world.
