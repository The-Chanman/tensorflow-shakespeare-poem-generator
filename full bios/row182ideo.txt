Tiffany Chen
Tiffany is a Senior Environments Designer in the Design for Learning studio at IDEO.
With a passion for research and getting tangible, she believes design is at its best when it inspires creative curiosity and iterative learning. At IDEO, her work is grounded in synthesizing interdisciplinary connections and amplifying the impact of spaces through a deep understanding of the experiences it inspires and supports.
From designing an international school from the ground up to cultivating a maker mindset at a community college, Tiffany creates systems and environments that inspire learning experiences beyond the classroom. She is most inspired when co-creating with partners and learning side-by-side with embedded clients.
Prior to IDEO, Tiffany worked as an architectural designer at Gensler and Pei Cobb Freed & Partners. She received her Master in Architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design and Bachelor of Architecture and minor in Digital Studies at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.
