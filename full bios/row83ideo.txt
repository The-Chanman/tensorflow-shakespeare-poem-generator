Nazlican Goksu
As a Design Research Specialist at Design for Change Studio, Nazlican collaborates with teams to uncover real needs, behaviors and key moments to design around.
Prior to joining IDEO, Nazlican co-founded her design studio in New York, where she led design research in a variety of contexts, from industrial design to social impact projects. Her favorite challenges are systemic ones, especially the ones involving urban design.
She earned her B.A. in Product Design from Central Saint Martins, University of the Arts London. Her approach to design research is also influenced by social anthropology that she learned more while going through a Post Baccalaureate Program in Human Sciences at Columbia University.
Nazlican is also one of the founding members of TAK, a non-profit design group within the Mayor's office in Istanbul dedicated to tackle urban scale problems with design processes.
