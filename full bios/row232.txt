John Grimley
John joined IDEO Chicago in March 2000 to head its model shop. Since then, he has expanded the shopâ€™s services significantly, making it capable of producing very complex models through the acquisition and use of new modelmaking technology, such as the 3D printer for rapid prototyping and evaluations of basic shapes.
Before joining IDEO Chicago, he created models for several movies. Two of these "Armageddon" and "Mighty Joe Young" were nominated for Academy Awards in Best Visual Effects. He created and produced a detailed resin "flying saucer" model hobby kit and decorations for Las Vegas casinos as well. While working in the movie industry, John learned that time is of the essence and chaos runs free.
John earned his BFA in Industrial Design from the Cleveland Institute of Art.
