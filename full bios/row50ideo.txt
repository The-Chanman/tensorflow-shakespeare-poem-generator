Maura Cass
Maura Cass works as a Senior Design Researcher and Project Lead at IDEO, an international design and consulting firm, where her commitment to optimism, and love for people drives everything she does. She believes strongly in the power of design to make sense of complex challenges, increase mutual understanding, and ultimately create new solutions that impact the lives of people in tangible ways.
Maura's expertise lies in leading multi-disciplinary teams, conducting qualitative user research, simplifying the complex and building actionable design strategy.  She uses her background in anthropology and her analytical mind to help make sense of new environments, cultures, communities, organizations and people. This foundation has allowed her to work with a vast array of clients including start-ups, non-profits, government entities, and large private companies to bring new experiences and services - both physical, digital to the world. While Maura's experience is broad, her true passion has been designing for health, whether helping to scale a disruptive hospice care model, creating new experiences and services for a large women's healthcare provider,  or designing a digital platform to activate memory and enable deeper connection across generations. 
Prior to IDEO Maura worked in international health and development where she had the privilege to work with companies and organizations in both the private and public sectors to address systemic health issues in resource poor settings requiring navigation of unpredictable political, cultural, and social systems. Her work has taken her to over 15 countries including Ukraine, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, and South Africa. 
Maura holds a degree in Anthropology from Dartmouth College. When not working Maura can be found outdoors, in the woods, on a mountain, or by the ocean.
