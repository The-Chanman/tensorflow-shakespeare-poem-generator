BECKY'S BIOGRAPHY
Becky Bermont is an Portfolio Director and Organization Designer at IDEO Cambridge. She is passionate about the intersection of creativity and leadership, and works with clients to develop design-led approaches that will help them thrive in a highly dynamic world.

Prior to IDEO, Becky spent six years at the Rhode Island School of Design, leading the marketing and communications group and serving on the leadership team for the College. She most recently built out an organizational design strategy to advance innovation at eBay Inc., and has also lead innovation partnership programs between academia and corporations at the MIT Media Lab and RISD, launched mobile products at Yahoo! and started a quantitative market research consulting practice at Forrester Research. Her obsession with understanding how people and organizations respond to change has motivated all of her work.

Becky has an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business and a BA in Psychology from Wesleyan University. She co-authored the book Redesigning Leadership with former RISD president John Maeda, and has been published alongside him in Design Observer and the Harvard Business Review. She enjoys creative direction in the kitchen (though her husband does the cooking), and her weekly religion is yoga.
