MICHELLE'S BIOGRAPHY
Michelle Kwasny is a Design Research Lead at IDEO’s Boston studio. Michelle enjoys complex challenges that require making sense of large amounts of data. With experience in market research, usability and design, she merges quantitative and qualitative methods to both inspire and validate design innovation.

Since joining IDEO in 2010, Michelle has guided teams in designing new trash and recycling systems for the City of Boston, digital banking tools, the first beer can for one of America’s premiere craft brewers, educational innovation initiatives, injection devices and electronic medical records. She is passionate about finding the signal through the noise - getting to pure insight from raw ethnography and turning observation into something useful and usable for design. She has lectured on this topic at Harvard, MIT, and other institutions.

Prior to IDEO, Michelle sought to understand job seeking behaviors at Monster.com, studied generational and gender differences of privacy attitudes at Georgia Tech, validated improvements to online applications at Google, and made sales projections for consumer products with ACNielsen BASES.

Michelle holds a Master’s degree in Human-Computer Interaction from Georgia Tech in Atlanta and a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, IT and Business from Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana.
