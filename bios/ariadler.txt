ARI'S BIOGRAPHY
Ari Adler is a Senior Portfolio Director at IDEO's Cambridge studio, where he guides our portfolio of work around the design of product experiences.  Ari is particularly interested in how emerging technologies are enabling new human experiences, and fundamentally changing the way we relate to the physical and digital  products in our lives.

At IDEO, Ari leads client relationships, shapes work, guides project teams, mentors individuals, and regularly plays team-building Tetris in order to help keep the studio running smoothly.

In addition to leading a portfolio of work, Ari has facilitated design and innovation workshops for corporate clients, academic institutions, and nonprofits in the US, Europe, and Latin America and has lectured on design thinking and human-centered product innovation. Recently he co-taught a course titled “Designing Things for Humans” at the Harvard GSD. Before joining IDEO, Ari designed products at another design consultancy.

Ari holds a BS in Physics and Mathematics from Brandeis University, and an MS in Mechanical Engineering from MIT, where he was a researcher at the Media Lab. For his Master's thesis, he designed a low-cost telemedicine system for use in less developed countries.

Ari is happy to be back to MIT often, acting as IDEO's liaison to the Media Lab. In addition to the US, Ari has lived in Mexico and Colombia, and is fluent in Spanish.
