TIMOTHY'S BIOGRAPHY
Tim is a Design Lead at IDEO Tokyo with backgrounds in computer science, interaction design, entrepreneurship, and business. He gets most excited when he finds opportunities to bring his diverse skills together into one project to design products and services that truly help people (and of course business bottom lines). Prior to joining the Tokyo studio, Tim worked in IDEO's San Francisco and Palo Alto locations helping clients bring digital strategies to life, often finding unique opportunities to bring hardware and software together in brand new ways. Outside of client work but inside IDEO, he helped to build and launch Spark Camera, Project Edison, and ChitChat. He's also a trained barista, a skill gained from a stint at Blue Bottle Coffee while away from IDEO, and can make pretty decent latte art.

Tim originally hails from Irvine, California, and holds a B.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University.
