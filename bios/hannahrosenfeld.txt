HANNAH'S BIOGRAPHY
As a Design Researcher at IDEO, Hannah puts her innate curiosity, love for people and creative problem solving skills to work transforming compelling human stories into impactful solutions for (and with) her clients.

A technological curious researcher, Hannah is particularly interested in how human-centered design can help emerging technology make it out of research labs and into people's lives by matching it with real, meaningful and commercially viable needs. More than just problem solving, this approach pulls on her skills in problem finding as well as her ability to create useful frameworks to understand and articulate design opportunities around them. Hannah favors a co-creation approach to doing this, and works in creative ways to engage designers, experts and potential users across the research and design process.

Hannah holds a BA from Washington University in St. Louis and a Master of Interaction Design from Carnegie Mellon University. Her work exploring immersive projection and augmented reality has been presented at the Conference on Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interactions (TEI), 2017 and the Microsoft Design Expo, 2017. Prior to IDEO, Hannah spent five years in Thailand and India where she collaborated with non-profit organizations and social enterprises to help them identify a path to achieving triple bottom line success. This unique professional background has given her a strong interdisciplinary perspective and cultural sensitivity, which she brings to all of her projects.

When she's not in the studio or out in the field for research, Hannah can be found making a mess in the kitchen, tending to her tiny garden or talking to strangers at the farmers market.
