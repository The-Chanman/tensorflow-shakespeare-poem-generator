ANN'S BIOGRAPHY
Ann is a Design Lead at IDEO’s Boston office. Ann is interested in the human dimension of design – what motivates people, how they think, how they choose – and using storytelling as a design tool. She has worked on projects for diverse clients, including American Express, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and GE, and is passionate about bringing impact and innovation to public and private sectors through design.

 Before joining IDEO, Ann worked for over a decade as a filmmaker and TV & radio journalist. Her work captures the range of her interests: uncovering life in North Korea to circumcision as HIV prevention in Southern Africa to investigating the counterfeit drug trade in India. Other credits include Frontline, NOVA, DesignSquad, Antiques Roadshow (remembered as one of her best summer jobs), as well as a number of independent documentaries. Ann’s work has been broadcast on PBS and public radio and various film festivals, and has been recognized with the duPont-Columbia Awards, broadcast journalism's highest honor. She continues her work as a filmmaker, currently in post-production on her Sundance-supported documentary about about matchmaking for HIV-positive singles in India.

Ann holds a joint degree in Anthropology and the Study of Religion from Harvard College. She is an avid traveler, with Patagonia and Tibet among her favorite spots and obsessive photographer.
