TOM'S BIOGRAPHY
Tom brings over 16 years of experience in digital advertising, graphic design and art direction to his role as Senior Interaction Designer at IDEO.

He approaches projects with an eye for engagement and empathy, letting emotion and storytelling set a strong foundation for meticulous, human-centered design. His resulting work marries the naturally relatable with the technically refined.

At IDEO Tom has worked on a wide-range of projects including web, mobile apps and physical digital products. Most recently he has designed a digital physical UI on a brewing machine aimed at true coffee connoisseurs. He art-directed an interactive TV platform for a major sports network and helped a fortune 100 company launch several digital prototypes exploring the future of personal finance.

Prior to joining IDEO, Tom lead the design group at SapientNitro, served as Director of Design at Beam Interactive, and held senior creative roles at Isobar, de-construct, MRM Partners and Less Rain in his native London.

Tom is also a passionate photographer, specializing in landscapes and portraiture. His work has been published in magazines, album art, and music blogs. Tom maintains a photo journal featuring images from his travels, and a collection of vintage cameras that make dusting a serious undertaking.

He lives with his wife in a historic New England home they are busy renovating. After the recent birth of his daughter, he is currently hard at work on his dad jokes.
