LINDSEY'S BIOGRAPHY
Lindsey Turner is a Communication Design Lead at IDEO Cambridge, where she transforms research insights into thoughtful content strategy and compelling visual stories. She has a deep interest in language, disruptive brand thinking, and in the power of typography and images to clarify complex information and further a client's vision.

At IDEO, she has worked in industries ranging from healthcare to financial services to food and beverage startups, in brand identity, naming, advertising, interaction, and service design sectors. Most recently, she envisioned a holistic product and service platform for an audio company, helped a fortune-500 pharma company launch an innovation lab, and designed a brand strategy to help a century-old non-profit forge deeper connections with its members.

Prior to joining IDEO, Lindsey was Design Director at ALARM Press, a publisher of books and magazines devoted to music culture and inspiring design dialogue, as well as Art Director for a lifestyle publishing and events company in Austin, Texas. In past lives, she worked at a digital agency in Chicago, where she designed large-scale corporate web design projects, and she has provided identity systems and graphic design services to clients ranging from small product startups to national architecture firms. Her print roots and obsession with grids and systems is evident in everything she designs.

Lindsey studied English and Film Studies in Boulder, Colorado before transferring to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) where she earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts in Visual Communication. Outside of IDEO, she can be found playing music, exploring the great outdoors, and cooking gourmet meals....just kidding, she's probably just chasing after her 2.5-year-old twins.
