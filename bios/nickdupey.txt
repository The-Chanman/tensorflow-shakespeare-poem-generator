NICK'S BIOGRAPHY
Nick DuPey is a Design Director at IDEO Boston where he focuses on brand design, systems thinking and is dedicated to leading teams towards innovative solutions that communicate the unique values and stories of each respective client.

Over his career Nick has worked across a multitude of industries, including food and beverage, media and entertainment, pharmaceutical, consumer goods, and education. Most recently Nick worked with the Department of Homeland Security to innovate the United States immigration experience. During this two year engagement, he lead the design team in rebranding the digital immigration landscape, creating a world class digital ecosystem for the United States Government.

Nick specializes in leading design for complex communications, organizational and branding challenges, and always takes a hands-on approach to every design project.
