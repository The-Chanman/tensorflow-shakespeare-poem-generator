LAUREN'S BIOGRAPHY
Lauren Kim is a Design Lead at IDEO Cambridge working at the cross section between physical and digital space. Formally trained in architecture and graphic design, her passion in holistic design straddles scale and medium; from creating meaningful engagement at the level of pixel and paper, to inspiring impact at the scale of buildings and urban spaces. At IDEO, she has worked on projects that range from interactive and architectural experiences, to new ventures, brands and services in industries that include finance, healthcare, real estate, and government.

Prior to IDEO, she worked at both Frog Design and Smart Design as a Communication and Visual Designer. Her projects spanned digital services, branding, publication design, products and package design with clients that included Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Sprint, and HP.

Lauren's work has been featured in numerous exhibitions and publications including AIGA 365, Interior Design Magazine and Novum. Lauren earned her Master of Architecture from the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, where her work was exhibited and published internationally. She holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design with a minor in Belief Systems from the Rhode Island School of Design.
